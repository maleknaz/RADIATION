y,Removing deutch translations because it was not up to date,
y,removing all this language stuff -- we barely have translations and it's broken anyway.,
y,ZVISION: Clean up the TruetypeFont class and add alpha support  Remove caching. We don't render font enough to warrant it. Use Graphics::TextAlign instead of rolling our own. Remove methods we don't use.,
y,X 1. remove action X 2. Fix the daily reminder X 3. Add the time in the righthand side button X 4. Delete list item (from menu),
y,Work on style : Drawer and PTR color  * Remove drawer transparency * Change PTR color to the same as the logo,

n,ZVISION: Set all the internal graphics operations to use RGB555 (2/2)  This is the second part of the changes to make the engine use RGB555 internally again. This is done to simplify the rendering pipeline - the engine will use RGB555 internally but will output to RGB565. The overall changes have been broken into two commits with this commit finishing all the changes.  This is needed as the game uses RGB555 graphics internally but its AVI animations (full screen and in-game) use RGB565,

n,Update themes,
n,Update theme based on current site,
n,Update the way backgrounds are displayed to work with cropped images  As the backgrounds we have are squared we modify the way we display them: Instead of doing a setBackground() on the root view (which uses a scale type FIT_CENTER) we now have an ImageView which displays the background image.  And we specify a scale type of CENTER_CROP.  Also update the bg_fox background to the square image and do some code cleaning in MainActivity,
n,Windows: Remove an unused function.,
n,update the torrent data in the detail fragment if the current torrent has been deleted,
n,WiimoteReal: Don't block on refresh  This changes Refresh() to use the existing scanning thread to scan for devices instead of running the scan on the UI thread and blocking it.  Also makes the UI thread not block when Continuous Scanning is disabled and removes duplicated code.  Should fix issue 8992.  Under the hood: * The scanning thread is now always active even when continuous scanning is disabled. * The initialize code which waits for Wiimotes to be connected also uses the scanning thread instead of scanning on yet another thread. * The scanning thread now always checks for disconnected devices to avoid Dolphin thinking a Wiimote is still connected when it isn't. So we now check if we need new Wiimotes or a Balance Board at scan time.,

n,Update SQL query generation to handle mainspace and other null params  This patch updates the generation of SQL query parameters to be passed to the content provider by generating primaryKeySelection and PrimaryKeySelectionArgs values based on the properties of a specific object handling null values for namespace (or any other field) appropriately.  This eliminates the problems of duplicate history and saved page entries and allows deleting history and saved pages entries one at a time whether the underlying pages are in mainspace (i.e. have a NULL value stored as their namespace) or otherwise.

Once done the widget won't update the time anymore until the application is re-opened by the user (or possibly our background weather service) - Furthermore the handler kept the application alive consuming more battery than required especially if actually no time widget is used by the user  Instead using an alarm receiver to schedule updates to an app that might not be running all the time is the recommended way,

n,"Add Butter Knife and upgrade Checkstyle  The Android app wants to do more with native Views. In this interest Butter Knife v7.0.1 is added a tool that is helpful in eliminating some of the boilerplate of native Views.  BK increases the size of the dev release apk from 4201830B to 4220733B about ~~18KiB.  To verify that the library is working properly one usage of BK is made in ArticleHeaderView.  BK uses annotations and requires annotated fields to be non-private which violates Checkstyle rules. The implicit Checkstyle version was v5.9[0] which does not support the ignoreAnnotationCanonicalNames property of the VisibilityModifier module. This patch upgrades Checkstyle to the latest v6.11.2 adds the BK @Bind annotated property exception and fixes all new violations of type ~""Redundant 'public' modifier~"".

n,Remove Android <ucontext.h> hack.  There was a longstanding hack that defined ucontext_t manually to work around the lack of this header on the Android NDK.  However it looks like newer NDK versions now have it like good little POSIX boys and my recent header reshuffle broke the build on those versions presumably because the real and fake definitions of ucontext_t end up included in the same file where they weren't under the old organization.  Rather than try to revert the conflict this commit just removes the hack.  The buildbot's NDK will need to be upgraded.,

No game was actually using it and also it wasn't being called again for different game states or different game parameters so it would have been a mistake to depend on anything in that game state. Games are now expected to commit in advance to a single fixed list of all the colours they will ever need which was the case in practice already and simplifies any later port to a colour-poor platform. Also this change has removed a lot of unnecessary faff from midend_colours().   git-svn-id: svn://svn.tartarus.org/sgt/puzzles@6416 cda61777-01e9-0310-a592-d414129be87e,

Untangle is exempt from this cleanup: its `just_solved' field is used to change the _length_ of the animation on Solve moves not to suppress it entirely and so it has to stay.   git-svn-id: svn://svn.tartarus.org/sgt/puzzles@6419 cda61777-01e9-0310-a592-d414129be87e,

n,Refactored the game_size() interface which was getting really unpleasant and requiring lots of special cases to be taken care of by every single game.

All the rest of the complexity is handled in the midend mostly by binary search so grubby special cases only have to be dealt with once.   git-svn-id: svn://svn.tartarus.org/sgt/puzzles@6059 cda61777-01e9-0310-a592-d414129be87e,

n,Paint/context preserving local state  I got to thinking that the paint variable state should be preserved after the drawing functions did their stuff. Saving and restoring individual values inside each function was getting messy so I implemented a local paint variable which was updated with the important stuff from the passed-in paints. The local variable is now used for all painting/drawing and the original paint guaranteed unchanged. I could see issues elsewhere if I changed something and other code was assuming it was already set.  So quite a bit of fiddling with the code to get this working but now it's clean.  I also did a bit of work on the arrows - see video at https://youtu.be/wvE9HUDMqSM  Basically they're much nicer but also they are coloured. It's just an experimental thing where the colour is based upon the distance along the track; using the same rainbow scaling as the altitude display does; that is... purple up to red.,

n,"VideoCommon: rework anamorphic widescreen heuristic  Some widescreen hacks (see below) properly force anamorphic output but don't make the last projection in a frame 16:9 so Dolphin doesn't display it correctly.  This changes the heuristic code to assume a frame is anamorphic based on the total number of vertex flushes in 4:3 and 16:9 projections that frame. It also adds a bit of ~""aspect ratio inertia~"" by making it harder to switch aspect ratios which takes care of aspect ratio flickering that some games / widescreen hacks would be susceptible with the new logic.  I've tested this on SSX Tricky's native anamorphic support Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell (it stayed in 4:3 the whole time) and on the following widescreen hacks for which the heuristic doesn't currently work:  Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door (Gecko widescreen code from Nintendont) C202F310 00000003 3DC08042 3DE03FD8 91EEF6D8 4E800020 60000000 00000000 04199598 4E800020 C200F500 00000004 3DE08082 3DC0402B 61CE12A2 91CFA1BC 60000000 387D015C 60000000 00000000 C200F508 00000004 3DE08082 3DC04063 61CEE8D3 91CFA1BC 60000000 7FC3F378 60000000 00000000  The Simpsons: Hit & Run (AR widescreen code from the wiki) 04004600 C002A604 04004604 C09F0014 04004608 FC002040 0400460C 4082000C 04004610 C002A608 04004614 EC630032 04004618 48220508 04041A5C 38600001 04224344 C002A60C 04224B1C 4BDDFAE4 044786B0 3FAAAAAB 04479F28 3FA33333",

Since N it _does_ handle lists but only unordered ones so our special handling broke because we don't get to see the <li> tags anymore. As there's no way to get a hook into the framework class import the necessary pieces of it and insert our special tag handling that used to live in the custom TagHandler instance into it.

Since CommentScreen is used for multireddits as well the PostLoader interface provides the neccesary methods to load submissions.  There are also numerous refactorings/removal of dead code most of which are minor.,

n,Hygiene: rename PersistenceHelper to DatabaseTable  There's a clear line of distinction between a ContentPersister and a PersistenceHelper.

A PersistenceHelper interacts directly with the database to for example create a specific table upgrade a specific table operate on a specific table's rows and columns and defines a Column nested class and the version of the database that the table was added. Rename PersistenceHelper to DatabaseTable so it's clear it has a lot to do with a specific table in the database. No functional changes intended.

n,"Tolerate packet reordering in the early init process  Fixes a bug where packet reordering made the server give the client two peer ids instead of one. This in turn confused reliable packet sending and made connecting to the server fail.  The client usually sends three packets at init: one ~""dummy~"" packet consisting of two 0 bytes and the init packet as well as its legacy counterpart. The last one can be turned off since commit af30183124d40a969040d7de4b3a487feec466e4 but this is of lower relevance for the bug. The relevant part here is that network packet reorder (which is a normal occurence) can make the packets reach the server in different order.  If reorder puts the dummy packet further behind the following would happen before the patch:  1. The server will get one of the init packets on channel 1 and assign the client a peer id as the packet will have zero as peer id.  2. The server sends a CONTROLTYPE_SET_PEER_ID packet to inform the client of the peer id.  3. The next packet from the client will contain the peer id set by the server.  4. The server sets the m_has_sent_with_id member for the client's peer structure to true.  5. Now the dummy packet arrives. It has a peer id of zero therefore the server searches whether it already has a peer id for the address the packet was sent from. The search fails because m_has_sent_with_id was set to true and the server only searched for peers with m_has_sent_with_id set to false.  6. In a working setup the server would assign the dummy packet to the correct peer id. However the server instead now assigns a second peer id and peer structure to the peer and assign the packet to that new peer.  7. In order to inform the peer of its peer id the server sends a CONTROLTYPE_SET_PEER_ID command packet reliably to the peer. This packet uses the new peer id.  8. The client sends an ack to that packet not with the new peer id but with the peer id sent in 2.  9. This packet reaches the server but it drops the ACK as the peer id does not map to any un-ACK-ed packets with that seqnum. The same time the server still waits for an ACK with the new peer id which of course won't come. This causes the server to periodically re-try sending that packet and the client ACKing it each time.  Steps 7-9 cause annoyances and erroneous output but don't cause the connection failure itself. The actual mistake that causes the connection failure happens in 6: The server does not assign the dummy packet to the correct peer but to a newly created one. Therefore all further packets sent by the client on channel 0 are now buffered by the server as it waits for the dummy packet to reach the peer which of course doesn't happen as the server assigned that packet to the second peer it created for the client. This makes the connection code indefinitely buffer the TOSERVER_CLIENT_READY packet not passing it to higher level code which stalls the continuation of the further init process indefinitely and causes the actual bug.  Maybe this can be caused by reordered init packets as well the only studied case was where network has reliably reordered the dummy packet to get sent after the init packets.  The patch fixes the bug by not ignoring peers where m_has_sent_with_id has been set anymore. The other changes of the patch are just cleanups of unused methods and fields and additional explanatory comments.  One could think of alternate ways to fix the bug:  * The client could simply take the new peer id and continue communicating with that. This is however worse than the fix as it requires the peer id set command to be sent reliably (which currently happens but it cant be changed anymore). Also such a change would require both server and client to be patched in order for the bug to be fixed as right now the client ignores peer id set commands after the peer id is different from PEER_ID_INEXISTENT and the server requires modification too to change the peer id internally. And most importantly right now we guarantee higher level server code that the peer id for a certain peer does not change. This guarantee would have to be broken and it would require much larger changes to the server than this patch means.  * One could stop sending the dummy packet. One may be unsure whether this is a good idea as the meaning of the dummy packet is not known (it might be there for something important) and as it is possible that the init packets may cause this problem as well (although it may be possible too that they can't cause this).  Thanks to @auouymous who had originally reported this bug and who has helped patiently in finding its cause.",

Added the Hebrew mo file for windows and osx (and update the others).   git-svn-id: https://dolphin-emu.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@6790 8ced0084-cf51-0410-be5f-012b33b47a6e,
n,Working on #24 - making it possible to cancel long-running ops like a clone  This commit actually fulfils Savvas's request that deleting a repo should cancel any download associated with that repo.  There's a bit more to do than that though as I'd like to add a 'cancel' button which will cancel the current op without actually deleting the repo  https://github.com/rtyley/agit/issues/24,

n,ZooniverseClient: Move generateAuthorizationHeader() to HttpUtilsTest.  And test it. And stop it from adding a newline at the end (by using Base64.NO_WRAP instead of Base64.DEFAULT). This didn't seem to bother the server and the server still accepts it without the newline.,

Also made PlainPasteEditText inherit from AppCompatEditText to make sure that any styling that we apply to EditText in the future will be applied properly by AppCompat.  Note: did *not* modify the EditText in the History and Saved Pages fragments since they're being affected by a known bug in AppCompat: https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=175228 Once the above issue is fixed we can finish those updates.

Refactored the unit test for PageLead so most of the code can be reused by both variants.  Bug: T102274 Change-Id: I78fda5c997e960b0871cff66fd7e3220d80e16e8,

n,Use more generic 'Security Token' where possible add sutitle to create key what tokens are supported,
n,use more generic java types when possible  When declaring variables as well as when defining the types passed to or returned from a method use more generic types when possible.  There is no need to require that a caller to a method pass a HashMap when really any Map implementation will do.  It is rare that a specific implementation of a particular Collection type is *really* required.  Also avoid use of wildcard generics (e.g. Vector<?>) when the generics type is known.  This prevents the need for casting values later on.  I suspect that many places where Vector is currently used would see performance increases (albeit minor) by using ArrayList instead.  That change is not part of this commit though will be made much easier with the changes here.,
n,Use modern dialog API via support lib to show pinentry  The dialog method we were using was using a deprecated API now it's using DialogFragment (from the support lib). The styles changes are to ensure that pinentry appears on top of everything using this fragment method like we expect.,

When a device is rotated while an AsyncTask is running the result of that AsyncTask should be transferred to the new Activity/Fragment.

Since AsyncTask.onPostExectue() and onCreate()/onCreateView() are both running on the main thread they can never overlap and the result is always realized in the latest active object.,

The UpdaterTest has been simplified to overload the mock networking using the ServiceLocator.  Minor changes to ServiceConfig are included so that only strings are needed to instantiate classes so that the ServiceConfig class does not need build time dependencies on any other class.,

n,The Mega Change Of Doom - or fixing Stop. Almost. At least it's better than before. However the OpenGL plugin seems to lose textures a lot between game restarts :P I think the GL plugin needs to do a lot more cleanup.  This change also includes tons of minor code formatting cleanup. Yeah should've separated it ... sorry :(  Kills the old CPUCompare support. I'll resurrect it if I need it again right now it mostly clutters the code.  git-svn-id: https://dolphin-emu.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@2321 8ced0084-cf51-0410-be5f-012b33b47a6e,

n,refactor WebViewActivity  WebViewActivity is primarily used to display post and page previews as well as display the WordPress admin dashboard.  It looks like it previously was also used for the WordPress.com reader?  This change refactors WebViewActivity into several classes to provide a cleaner API making it easier to add additional WebViews (coming soon) and removes a significant chunk of duplicated and/or obsolete code. There *should* be no user-visible changes here.  This change also starts putting Activities into the 'ui' package as things are getting a little crowded in org.wordpress.android.,
n,"Refactor the theming system  The theming support was a huge headache for maintenance even while I wasn't having it active. Themes with light-colored keys don't work well with the light-colored symbol icons (such as shift tab enter backspace). The unfortunate solution chosen had been to duplicate all the keyboard XML definitions with separate ~""_black~"" versions that had the exact same layout and mapping and only differed by selecting an alternate dark-colored icon.  Adding insult to injury the dark icon set isn't very usable since the icons are rather blurry presumably these weren't updated since the theming support wasn't active in the released Gingerbread keyboard.  This change removes color awareness from KeyboardSwitcher and mostly from LatinKeyboard as preparation for getting rid of the duplicated XML files and icons entirely.",
n,Refactor ShowHabit screen; remove fragment,
n,Refactor modifier key handling  The modifier key handling was fairly broken and only really worked right with ConnectBot. Other Android applications got key events without the appropriate SHIFT CTRL and META modifiers I had originally removed those due to issue 24 (Shift causes next number to be entered as shift+number).  Now that Honeycomb and ICS actually make use of the Ctrl key for example for Ctrl-X/C/V/A shortcuts need to make sure that the key modifiers get reported properly in the generated key events.  The new system now generates appropriate low-level key events when modifier keys are active instead of relying on the input method libraries to do so. This is based on an ascii-to-keycode map to determine the appropriate base character. Don't use the odd special handling for digits that had caused the breakage in issue 24.  TODO: watch out for regressions key event handling is a bit confusing in Android especially in older versions that had odd dependencies on built-in hardcoded base keymaps.,

Because of this it can be used in release builds without much impact the only thing that woudl change is the use of HasAny method instead of preprocessor conditionals.  Since the perforamnce decrease comes right when the first memcheck is added and restored when the last is removed it basically is all beneficial and works the same way.,

The original code had a special case for digits as the leftmost character of the popup keyboard and used that to decide if it wants to align the left or right edge of the popup above the key being held.  The new logic always aligns the popup keyboard so that it extends towards the center of the screen.  Also remove digits from popups for the qwerty row in full mode.  This change also updates the popup key mappings to match the new logic. I had to remove a few symbols on ~""4~"" to fit Lira/Peso/Franc are now on the L/P/F keys.",
m,Merge the fullscreen change from master to donut for security.  Rework the AlarmAlert dialog layout.  Make the layout portrait only to make it more uniform and nicer looking. Update all the clock layouts to have the same size. The alert will have a larger clock than the AlarmClock screen.  Remove the old hack to make the alert a dialog.  Inflate the views with a root so the layout params will be fill_parent. Use the animate_circle resource in setBackgroundResource to clean up the code.  Add a new AlarmAlertFullScreen activity which makes the alert fullscreen with the current wallpaper as the background. Query the keyguard manager during the alarm broadcast to decide which activity to launch. The regular alert activity shows above the current activity but the fullscreen activity will not show the previous activity for security reasons.  Add the alarm_alert style that mimics the Theme.Dialog.Alert style but does not rely on a private resource. Add dialog.9.png for the same reason.  Add a LinearLayout surrounding the alert layout to hold the background wallpaper.,
m,IniFile: Remove support for comments anywhere but the beginning of lines  The MS INI parser and most other INI parsing libraries APIs only support comments at the beginning of lines. Right now some Game INI files use sections like:  [OnFrame]#Add memory patches here  But these section headers are parsed separately so this should not break them.,

m,V. 2.1.4: Permission ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION  removed,
m,UWP: Remove tests configuration. Start experimenting with CI.,
m,UserDatabase activity removed  Add and Update dialog boxes could be directly called from ManageUser Basically proceeding towards reducing activities and improving user interface,
m,Use warningstream for log messages with WARNING  Remove DTIME macro and its uses too,
m,Use up to date build targets. Format Manifest according to Android Guidelines. Remove cruft (we have version control for that).,
m,Use Retrofit for direct mobileview page load  * Added new library + license info + ProGuard rules devRelease apk size difference: before: 3812413 bytes after:  3852942 bytes = +40KB * Implemented PhpApi Retrofit service endpoint * JsonPageLoadStrategy ApiTasks converted to use Retrofit callbacks * New Gson POJOs for PageLead and PageRemaining * PageLead Gson parsing had an issue with the protection field --> had to use custom JSON deserializer for the protection field due to T69054. * pageLead request uses formatversion=2 to make handling boolean values easier. pageRemaining doesn't have any booleans so not needed there yet (but probably wouldn't hurt). * section: ArrayList -> List * new Section(json) -> Section.fromJson(json) * Retrofitted RefreshSavedPageTask functionality * Get Main page for widget (also added slight optimization) * SectionsFetchTaskTests -> PageLoadTests * Removed SectionFetchTask * Add noimages flag (have to skip sending the parameter when false since the MW API takes the mere presence of the parameter as a true value) * Add W0 mcc-mnc enrichment header * Add other custom headers * Get W0 X-CS header * Use OkHttpClient cookie handler and cache * Cache the RestAdapter's output the service object since this is a memory intensive object. See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20579185/is-there-a-way-to-reuse-builder-code-for-retrofit#answer-20627010  I started most of the POJO files using jsonschema2pojo.org. But manually updated them to introduce the static inner classes added some convenience methods; and of course last but not least add the custom deserializer for the MwPageLead.Protection object.  The parts I don't like are the extra de-/serialization steps in Section.java. I think it's probably better to leave that to use org.json.JSONObject parsing instead of using Gson since we pass the former over to the JS bridge. Now toJSON() builds a new JSONObject just for that. Oh well.  The code is already structured so that it's easy to plug in a new way of loading page content through RESTBase. It was a bit rough to genericize regular Retrofit interfaces which are used to generate the Retrofit endpoint functionality. If it wasn't for that this code would have been quite a bit simpler and more standard Retrofit. Sorry Jake.  Change-Id: I0ea27355780f8d1550b743714454b5fe701d4490,
m,Use a singleton for fetching images  This:  - Saves ~~ 12% of device memory in most cases as most activities had a cache as did NowPlayingFragment and they were different memory caches.  - Persists the memory cache between different activities.  Implementation:  - Provide Squeezer.getImageFetcher() to create-and-return the singleton.  - Modify ImageWorker to stop using a fragment to retain the cache as it persists for the lifetime of the application.  - Modify ImageFetcher to no longer extend ImageResizer.  - Remove all the code that creates and passes ImageFetchers around as additional parameters.,
m,Use a single UI element to display the coin unit in send subaccount balance view  Remove CurrencyMapper.mapBtcUnitToPrefix since its now no longer needed.,
m,Use `ContextCompat.getDrawable()` and remove ResourceUtils,
m,Upgrade TranslationTests to JUnit 4  A follow-up to 4994f86 and 8d2b632 remove indirect WebView dependency from missed test TranslationTests. TranslationTests depended on PageActivity which uses a WebView. Also upgrade to JUnit 4. Tested on:  â¢ Pass â¢ Failure: remove HTML from es/wp_stylized â¢ Failure: change %s to %d in iw/last_updated_text  Bug: T133183 Change-Id: Ibb476fc463e26f1f5c93f47cf926c08b874b985a,
m,Upgrade notifications on status bar when uploading to show proper message about fails due to lack of permissions and removed FailedUploaderActivity,
m,Update dependencies Remove recyclerview animations library and use defaults.,
m,Update build HOWTO. Remove eclipse build cruft.,
m,uniform way of accessing SDK level via final static field for efficiency and JIT optimizations. Removed alternative methods and redundant checks (eg SDK_VERSION > 3),
m,Tweaked @TargetApi annotations in SDLSurface.java  Removed the all-encompassing Lint suppression at the top of the class.  Added pinpoint suppression annotations in the critical areas.  This will allow Lint to catch other TargetApi issues later as code develops (a good thing).  As an analogy this is like disabling specific compiler warnings over certain blocks of code rather than disabling all compiler warnings over the entire file.,
m,Tidy up how custom icons are included in css  This tidies up the custom theme's icons which were overly complicated and badly setup - almost as if we were (ab)using css intended to make extra large icons to make retina icons instead but we'd only got halfway. I've tidied this up so that we use the 36px icons properly - keeping most properties the same as the 18px ones but scaling the background image appropriately to make it hi-dpi. Since there seemed to be some issue with iOS not obeying the media query on the @import statement that loaded this css I also decided to just bundle the rules directly into fms-jquerymobile.css  In addition I took the opportunity to make black icons the default (instead of white) meaning that we could remove an awful lot of css overrides in fms.css that were swapping colors for different icons individually.  Closes #217,
m,The service part has been rewritten from scratch. Improvements: now it works. Updates should be checked automatically every day. Notifications are displayed when new versions are available.  Next the Service and the Activity should communicate. Also the application should detect installed and removed applications.,
m,The fix for updating favourites in sync with last anime: update both at the same time! This also meant that FavouriteUpdateEvent was removed since it serves no purpose atm.,
m,Whitelist: Use SwipeRefreshLayout instead of Progress  This gives us the ability to swipe to refresh the list of apps if apps have been installed in the meantime. It would be nicer to listen to intents and refresh automatically but this solution is easier.,r

m,"Refactor opcode decoding a bit to kill FifoCommandRunnable.  Separated out from my gpu-determinism branch by request.  It's not a big commit; I just like to write long commit messages.  The main reason to kill it is hopefully a slight performance improvement from avoiding the double switch (especially in single core mode); however this also improves cycle calculation as described below.  - FifoCommandRunnable is removed; in its stead Decode returns the number of cycles (which only matters for ~""sync~"" GPU mode) or 0 if there was not enough data and is also responsible for unknown opcode alerts.  Decode and DecodeSemiNop are almost identical so the latter is replaced with a skipped_frame parameter to Decode.  Doesn't mean we can't improve skipped_frame mode to do less work; if at such a point branching on it has too much overhead (it certainly won't now) it can always be changed to a template parameter.  - FifoCommandRunnable used a fixed large cycle count for display lists regardless of the contents.  Presumably the actual hardware's processing time is mostly the processing time of whatever commands are in the list and with this change InterpretDisplayList can just return the list's cycle count to be added to the total.  (Since the calculation for this is part of Decode it didn't seem easy to split this change up.)  To facilitate this Decode also gains an explicit 'end' parameter in lieu of FifoCommandRunnable's call to GetVideoBufferEndPtr which can point to there or to the end of a display list (or elsewhere in gpu-determinism but that's another story).  Also as a small optimization InterpretDisplayList now calls OpcodeDecoder_Run rather than having its own Decode loop to allow Decode to be inlined (haven't checked whether this actually happens though).  skipped_frame mode still does not traverse display lists and uses the old fake value of 45 cycles.  degasus has suggested that this hack is not essential for performance and can be removed but I want to separate any potential performance impact of that from this commit.",

m,Mark which Wii root to use in the NAND path code.  It's used by both the GUI to do things like install WADs and check up on the system menu in which case the global root should be used and by /dev/es in which case the local one should.  The latter isn't *terribly* useful today since no contents will ever be installed in temporary roots (although it's still relevant for data directories) but converting the whole thing makes sense because then it will Just Work once the entire NAND is synced.  Because it would have been a bit of work to split it up (but I can if desired) this commit also contains some basic cleanup of NANDContentLoader:  (1) The useless interface class INANDContentLoader is removed and the methods are changed to just return CNANDContentLoader (the only implementation); (2) CNANDContentManager is changed to use unique_ptr and cleaned up a bit.,

m,[Android] Tegra 4 'support.' This brings up the OpenGL backend to support Tegra 4 to the point where it will run games but it doesn't have any video output for some reason. This is a large change that doesn't actually change much functionally. Walking through the changes. It changes the string in the Android backend select to just OpenGL ES. Adds a check in the Android code to check for Tegra 4 and to enable the option to select the OpenGL ES backend. Adds a DriverDetails bug under BUG_ISTEGRA as a blanket case of Tegra 4 support. The changes that effects most lines in this change. Removing all float suffixes in the pixel/vertex/util shaders since OpenGL ES 2 doesn't support float suffixes. Disables the shaders for reinterpreting the EFB format since Tegra 4 doesn't support integers. Changes GLFunctions.cpp to grab the correct Tegra extension functions. Readds the GLSL 1.2 'hacks' as GLSLES2 'hacks' since they are required for GLSL ES 2 Adds a GLSLES2 to the GLSL_VERSION enum. Disable the SamplerCache on Tegra since Tegra doesn't support samplers... Enable glBufferSubData on Tegra since it is the only mobile GPU to correctly work with it. Disable glDrawRangeElements on Tegra since it doesn't support it This uses glDrawElements instead.,

Users of the new library are expected to instantiate (or subclass) TermSession connect it to the emulation client via an InputStream and OutputStream and then attach it to an EmulatorView which will display the terminal screen and scrollback.  In the app we subclass both TermSession (ShellTermSession) and EmulatorView (TermView) to consolidate the setting and updating of preferences in one place.  Since tty-related handling stays in the app (there's no guarantee library users will be using a tty) we also override various methods of TermSession to handle our tty functionality.,

m,"Builtin/profiler: Replace game profiler (#4245)  Use the setting ~""profiler.load~"" to enable profiling. Other settings can be found in settingtypes.txt.  * /profiler print [filter] - report statistics to in-game console * /profiler dump [filter] - report statistics to STDOUT and debug.txt * /profiler save [format [filter]] - saves statistics to a file in your worldpath * txt (default) - same treetable format as used by the dump and print commands * csv - ready for spreadsheet import * json - useful for adhoc D3 visualizations * json_pretty - line wrapped and intended json for humans * lua - serialized lua table of the profile-data for adhoc scripts * /profiler reset - reset all gathered profile data. This can be helpful to discard of any startup measurements that often spike during loading or to get more useful min-values.  [filter] allows limiting the output of the data via substring/pattern matching against the modname.  Note: Serialized data structures might be subject to change with changed or added measurements. csv might be the most stable due to flat structure.  Changes to the previous version include:  * Updated and extended API monitoring * Correct calculation of average (mean) values (undistorted by idleness) * Reduce instrumentation overhead. * Fix crashes related to missing parameters for the future and occasional DIV/0's. * Prevent issues caused by timetravel (overflow timejump NTP corrections) * Prevent modname clashes with internal names. * Measure each instrumentation individually and label based on registration order. * Labeling of ABM's and LBM's for easier classification. Giving several ABM's or LBM's the same label will treat them as one. Missing labels will be autogenerated based on name or registration order. * Configurable instrumentation and reporting. Skip e.g. builtin if you don't need it. * Profile the profiler to measure instrumentation overhead.",
m,New GPX track rendering and animation/overlay package.  WHAT THIS PROVIDES:  A generic rendering/draw of GPX tracks that allows multiple 'renders' to be included as a part of the draw of any TrkSegment. These 'renders' include the basic track drawing but also other options such as dashed lines rainbow-coloured altitude indication speed indication arrows to point direction animating 'lines' showing direction of movement and dots/text showing 1km (or any other) distances along tracks.  It's very extendable and incredibly cheap in terms of procesisng speed.  For a view of some of these operating on this version of the code see https://youtu.be/aRGCNLmBAlk  Additionally all of the above have automatic asynchronous track resampling - either via line culling of Ramer-Douglas-Peucer (implemented for the base track draw at different zooms) or an actual resampler that takes a distance and steps off and creates a new track with points spaced exactly that distance apart along the original track. The asynchronous resampling/culling willl automatically enable the new (optimal) track display when the background task has completed.  This is completely up to date with the master branch as of an hour or so ago!  Two modified files - GPXUtilities Added some fields to WptPt to enable distance measurement on tracks and colouring for altitude/speed - GPXLayer Installed the new track rendering with examples (commented/out)  Two new files - AsynchronousResampler.java Implements line resampling and culling asynchrnonously for all line drawing - Renderable.java Set of classes for drawing different kinds of gpx 'renders' - normal with automatic Ramer-Douglas-Peucer line culling - conveyor-belt type animation of segments on a path - altitude colouring of a path - speed colouring of a path - distance based waypoint/marker drawing,

m,WIP: More work on player sync groups. Bugs remain (see XXX comments).  - Use the syncmaster / syncslaves attributes of Players instead of the syncgroups command. This keeps all the information tied to the Players instead of having to fetch additional data from the server.  - Change PlayerListAdapter::updatePlayers() to use this information to construct the groups for the expandable list.  - Make the list of players in the expandable list stable by using their MAC address ID converted to a long as the child ID. Introduce a utility method to do the conversion with a test.  - Add a specific view for the group header of players with a minimum height.  - Instead of the service keeping track of a single PlayerState for the active player make PlayerState a member of each Player  - Track the player's syncmaster and syncslaves in the PlayerState.  - Adjust all the PlayerState::set*() methods to return a boolean indicating whether or not the value was changed. Use this in the service to determine wether to call each specific callback.  - Track all the seen players in a Map in ConnectionState. Add methods to modify the map as appropriate.  - Delete the IServicePlayersCallback::onSyncGroupsChanged() method and the ISqueezeService::syncgroups() method.,

m,This commit addresses the Hyrule field slowdown issue in Zelda: Twilight Princess as discussed in Xtreme2damax's thread: http://forums.dolphin-emu.com/thread-10638.html. It can be activated in the DX9 DX11 and OpenGL plugin GUI's. Enabling the hack while playing other games besides ZTP will likely have either an undesirable or no(more likely) effect.  The code changes disable the usual pipeline flush for certain BP Writes that occur while the minimap is being drawn in Zelda: twilight princess. This significantly increases speed while in hyrule field. The way this is accomplished is described more in depth on page 42 of Xtreme's thread. Big thanks to Xtreme for doing a great job hosting that thread and Kiesel-stein for initial work on the hack  Also I used the resource editor in Visual studio to generate the GUI code for the DX11 plugin and some code appeared to be removed although the behavior of the GUI did not seem to change. Hopefully someone more experienced with resource files (forms?) can double check that no code was damaged   git-svn-id: https://dolphin-emu.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@6057 8ced0084-cf51-0410-be5f-012b33b47a6e,

m,StreamingService: Explicit try/catch & remove/reverse conditionals.  The point of this commit is to remove the deep layers of nested conditionals inside showNotification(). This will make this member easier to read and improve. I do this by removing unnecessary conditionals and reversing/returning conditionals as required.  This commit also removes the try/catch block which encompassed the entire method. If we crash MPDroid because we're not handling exceptions we need to handle them and not paper over the problem IMHO.,
m,StreamingService: Add a workaround for streaming errors.  With MediaPlayer there is a racy bug which affects minimally Android KitKat and lower. If mediaPlayer.prepareAsync() is called too soon after mediaPlayer.setDataSource() and after a mediaPlayer.reset has been completed general and non-specific errors are usually emitted for the first few 100 milliseconds.  Sometimes these errors result in nagging Log errors sometimes these errors result in unrecoverable errors.  This patch sets up a handler which sets up a 1.5 second delay between mediaPlayer.setDataSource() and mediaPlayer.AsyncPrepare() whether first play after service start or not.  This patch also removes older custom code paths to workaround this problem.,

m,Restructure the image caching framework.  - Disk caching: Store images in the disk cache at the original resolution.  Store  ImageFetcher was maintaining a separate disk cache. Remove it and simplify processBitmap() to only download the bitmap instead of resizing it. All decisions about adding items to the cache are now made by ImageWorker.  - Memory caching: Store multiple copies of the image (potentially) in the memory cache keyed by the target width and height.  The target width and height are determined by inspecting the ImageView that the bitmap will be loaded in to (including waiting if the ImageView layout pass hasn't happened).  Pass these as a group of parameters to doInBackground via a new BitmapWorkerTaskParams POJO.  - Borrow an idea from Picasso and in debug builds include colour swatches on all images loaded this way -- red for fetched from the network blue for fetched from disk and green for fetched from memory.,
m,Restore .gitignore and SETUP.md remove files that were added,
m,Replaced old refreshview with SwipyRefreshLayout and removed some obsolete classes.,r
m,Replaced Common::CriticalSection with a std::mutex implementation. 64bit Windows builds now use SRWLocks and ConditionVariables(requires Vista/7 x64 builds will no longer work on Windows XP x64). Tell me if you hate that. Removed Common::EventEx. Common::Event now uses a std::condition_variable impl.(using ConditionVariables on Windows x64 Events on x86 or posix condition variables elsewhere). I experience slight speed improvements with these changes.  git-svn-id: https://dolphin-emu.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@7294 8ced0084-cf51-0410-be5f-012b33b47a6e,r

m,Replace SlidingDrawer with compatibility DrawerLayout  Remove actionable references (requires v7 overhaul)  Darken background and remove unused views  Fix alignment of pseudo action bar to list,r
m,Replace enums where practical with @IntDef or @StringDef equivalents.  Per the enum recommendations at https://developer.android.com/training/articles/memory.html.  This removes about 3MB from Squeezer's runtime footprint.,r
m,Replace doFocusHack with more descriptive setupFastClick  Removes doFocusHack from several places wher they weren't required. setupFastClick is also more specific (takes a selector). Also modify selectors to be more specific.,r

I've also changed some code that did not respect Java conventions.,

m,Removed use of LUT16to32 in HQx asm versions replacing some MMX code with 'plain' x86 code. Advantage: got rid of a 256kb table (reduces cache load so over here the code is about as fast as before; in particular since the affected interpolators are not used that often it seems). Moreover the new code is more accurate than the old ASM code which actually differed from what our C++ HQx did (sacrificing precision for speed i.e. cheating ;-)  svn-id: r36078,

While these make the list a lot longer they should improve usability quite a lot as they provide a visual clue as to the identity of the apps.  Also turn the checkbox into a switch. That just looks better in this context.,

m,Remove all instances of OpenCL in the Dolphin Project. A brief history of OpenCL in Dolphin. OpenCL was originally added to the Dolphin codebase 1 month after it was released with OS X Snow Leopard in 2009. OpenCL was one of the largest group projects that Dolphin ever has had. The OpenCL texture decoder was originally aded with version 1.0 of the OpenCL spec; This version didn't have the capability of a OpenCL-OpenGL interop which would allow for uploading textures once and have it decoded directly to a OpenGL texure. This was to be worked out when the OpenCL 1.1 spec was released and allowed the interop. This work has never been done and no one in the team is willing to work on it for various reasons. OpenCL has had the unreasonable expectation that it increases the performance of video games that require a large amount of EFB copies like NSMBW. In reality enabling OpenCL just put the graphics card in a higher power mode which increased the game speed. This is due to the unfortunate effect of Dolphin tending to not push GPUs out of their lower frequency power savings modes. Thanks to everyone that had contributed to the OpenCL texture decoder.,

Instead of having a linefeed in the string and having the code remove it if not needed the linefeed is now omitted from the string and the code adds it if needed.  Also the line ending is changed from \n to \r\n.  Also the string in the DE and FR locales had linefeeds at the start that were removed so they match all the other locales.  (The string in the zh-rTW locale was left alone since it had no linefeeds.  It looks like that file has numerous instances where \n was replaced with actual newlines which is probably not correct.),

m,Project did not compile after removing prefs_menu.xml,
m,Preview Subreddit Icon  It's supposed to be a monocle...  Remove the ldpi assets since I'm not testing them.,
m,Prevent redundant cover work in CoverView  There were two main cases where we would generate covers: when querySongs is called and when onSizeChanged is called. querySongs was sometimes called before the initial layout had occured and the CoverView's size determined (usually when the service had already been running when a new PlaybackActivity is created). onSizeChanged was sometimes called before the service had been initialized. Both of these cases are not useful and in the former case harmful since the default cover art could be shown when the view should have been blank. So this removes generation in onSizeChanged except when querySongs had been called before the layout occurs which elminates the redundant cases.,
m,Prevent backup loss when Activity gets killed. Remove useless support* methods.,
m,Prepare to support beta releases in the market.  - Add beta and live product flavours to build.gradle with a defaultConfig that mirrors AndroidManifest.xml  - As the version string may get more complicated update AboutDialog to support longer version strings.  Switch to using a RelativeLayout and move the version string to its own line.  This obsoletes some string resources so remove them.,
m,"points: use cache dir for share action (close #841)  We previously created a temporary file on external storage when sharing a file of points was needed. This is bad practice. Moreover there is no need to get write permission for sharing a file. Instead we can simply use internal storage and give temporary read permission when sharing via intent. Hence this is also safer.  As a consequence I also decided to remove the default ~""tmp dir~"" set in App. This is not needed anymore. By doing so we avoid a lot of problems notably on Android 6.0+ where it is required to ask for permission to write to external storage.",

m,Patch from Degasus that removes the last of the the GL_TEXTURE_RECTANGLE usages. This is needed to have GLES3 support.,
m,Pass the signing wallet to the wallet client in signTransaction  With this single change there is no further use of the signing wallet in the wallet client demonstrating that it doesn't really belong there.  Note that whether the wallet has been set or not is used as an indicator of whether the client can currently log in. This usage will be replaced with a boolean until it can be removed entirely.,
m,Particles: Add option to remove particles on collision  Adds the particle option `collision_removal = bool`  Some particles are hard to use right now since they either go through solid blocks (without collision detection) and with collision detection enabled they (e.g. raindrops) would just stop dead on the floor and sit there until they expire or worse scrape along a wall or ceiling.  We can solve the problem by adding a boolean flag that tells the particle to be removed if it ever collides with something. This will make it easier to add rain that doesn't fall through your roof or stick on the top of it. Or clouds and smoke that don't go through trees.  Particles that collide with this flag are marked expired unconditionally causing them to be treated like normal expired particles and cleaned up normally.  Documentation is adjusted accordingly.  An added bonus of this patch is that particles can potentially collide many times with nodes and this reduces the amount of collisions to 1 (max) which may end up reducing particle load on the client.,

m,"More FIFO work HACK Solution for extreme overflow on breakpoints.  1) What is the FIFO? The fifo is a ring queue for write (CPU) and read (GPU) the graphics commands. 2) What is the Brakpoints? The breakpoint is the FIFO mark to allow parallel work (CPU-GPU) When the GPU reached the breakpoint must stop read immediately until this Breakpoint will be removed for the CPU. 3) What is an overflow? The CPU write all room FIFO possible and like a ring overwrite commands not processed yet. 4) ¿Why you have an overflow? In theory should not have an overflow never because the fifo has another mark (High Watermark) When the CPU Write reach this mark raise a CP interruption and the FIFO CPU WRITES should stop write until distance between READ POINTER AND WRITE POINTER will be equal to another mark (LO Watemark to prevent and overflow. 5) ¡So if impossible why you have overflows? Simple the CP interruption is processed later and the Overflow happens. (there is a lot of theories about this) 6) ¿Why is no so simple like when CPU WRITE POINTER is near to the end of the FIFO only process pending graphics command? Because when this happens sometimes we are in BREAKPOINT and is IMPOSIBLE process the graphics commands.  - This HACK process the pending data when CPU WRITE POINTER is 32 bytes before the end of the fifo and if there is a Breakpoint force the situation to process the commands and prevent an overflown. In theory you have not see ~""FIFO is overflown by GatherPipe nCPU thread is too fast!~"" anymore. But if you have a hang in game where you had this please read the NOTICE LOG in user\logs I've added this message ~""FIFO is almost in overflown BreakPoint~"" when the hack is activated.

m,Material Design icons  from https://github.com/google/material-design-icons Some svg files had to be fixed because our convert script created some weird streaks in them. I loaded the svg files in Inkscape rotated the object cw and ccw and saved as new file. See also https://github.com/google/material-design-icons/issues/22. I tried to use the same names as the originals so that it's easier to find them in the Google repo. I just skipped the _..px suffix. The _24px files go into the /24/ folder. The _18px files go into the /18/ folder and so on. The dark theme versions of ic_expand_less and ic_expand_more have been manually tinted light gray.  Created a new hist_search icon based on ic_search but different color and smaller.  Also removed a few unused images: ic_fulltextsearch ic_menu_moreoverflow... ic_save  Change-Id: I488205e74adb0ef7e7336d643a2ed91d16d52841,

m,LOL: - Level temp data now get stored in memory so you can now return to a level without everything being broken. Temp data isn't saved to disk. Since total memory requirement for storing this data won't exceed ~~100kb I'd rather save memory in other places (like removing some screen page buffers) - Implemented some more opcodes and fixed some bugs (You can now safely pick up coin pouches.

m,LED doesn't blink with encryption enabled #261  Notifications in SMSSecure seem to rely mainly on two public methods:  MessageNotifier.updateNotification(Context MasterSecret long) and MessageNotifier.updateNotification(Context MasterSecret)  The difference between them is that the first is also aware of in thread notifications and triggers visual and audible alarms. Since the second method doesn't call setLights calling it after the first will cause the blinking lights to stop. This patch changes a number of things: - separate the alarms into visual and audio alarms. - so long as the notification is not canceled make the second method also call setLights if the first method was previously called. - removed unnecessary calls to the first method to avoid duplicate sound alarms.,

POV-ray benchmark with enableFPRF forced on for an extreme comparison: Before: 1500s After fmul/fmadd only: 728s After all float: 753s  In real games that use FPRF like F-Zero GX FPRF previously cost a few percent of total runtime.  Since FPRF is so much faster now if enableFPRF is set just do it for every float instruction not just fmul/fmadd like before. I don't know if this will fix any games but there's little good reason not to.,

m,I'm sick of repeatedly adding and removing local changes to Recipe when testing a new game so here's a new architecture for the Recipe file. mkfiles.pl now supports several new features:  - an `!include' directive which accepts wildcards - += to append to an existing object group definition - the ability to divert output to an arbitrary file.  So now each puzzle has a `.R' file containing a fragment of Recipe code describing that puzzle and the central Recipe does `!include *.R' to construct the Makefiles. That way I can keep as many experimental half-finished puzzles lying around my working directory as I like and I won't have to keep reverting Recipe when I check in any other changes.  As part of this change list.c is no longer a version-controlled file; it's now constructed by mkfiles.pl so that it too can take advantage of this mechanism.  [originally from svn r6781],

Issue 1562: Suppress notifications when new messages arrive in Trash Sent or Drafts special folders.,
m,Fix duplicate handling for Issue #23  Add an option for UID's to be global across all calendars defaulting to off. Add another duplicate handling option to replace duplicate events in the calendar they came from (this is not the default).  Although UIDs are meant to be globally unique it can be counter-intuitive to have events in other calendars changed without having configured the app to do so.

m,front: Wired special function input handling (many just stubs for now).  See the TODOs in PeripheralController for the functions that need to be implemented.  There's probably more than one good way to implement them so I'll leave that to you guys since you're more acquainted with the core implementation.  One remaining problem with the special function mapping is that it's possible to map the same key to multiple special functions or a special function and an N64 command. In either case the special func takes precedence over the N64 command and the special funcs at the bottom take precedence over the funcs at the top of the menu.  Consider this a temporary solution enough to get a Beta out the door. I think the better solution ultimately would be to extend the layout of the button mapping screen for Player 1. I'll probably tackle that once I take care of the other more pressing tasks like multiplayer.,

Temporary workaround is to set to false. - The TODO's in the last commit still apply.,
m,Stop using deprecated GTK 3 geometry-based functions.  Now we work out for ourselves how the drawing-area size relates to the overall window size by adding on the height of fe->menubar and/or fe->statusbar.,

m,Stop pretending we use SharedPreferences to store global/account settings,
m,stop polling BitBoat on inactivity to avoid unnecessary server load and battery drain,
m,Stage1: Introducing MotionPlus as emulated extension allowing us to boot games that require the MotionPlus itself. I also already implemented most of the needed data structures and datareport handling for the motionplus-nunchuk passthrough mode which I'll add up next as well.  Wii Sports Resort is now bootable by just using an emulated wiimote (only working under the old wiimote plugin atm I asked billiard to port my commit into his plugin since he knows his plugin better than me and its less work for him than for me I kept most parts of my code in modules to simplify that task).  Upcoming stage2: Faking the motionplus on the fly on real wiimotes that means you will be able to play e.g.  Redsteel2 with a real wiimote and nunchuk or wii sports resort with just your real wiimote. and nunchuk but w/o the need of having a real motionpluscontroller connected. The new Zelda 2010 will benefit by that since it will require a motionplus controller.  git-svn-id: https://dolphin-emu.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@5438 8ced0084-cf51-0410-be5f-012b33b47a6e,

m,Guide completions: Consolidate ApiEvents  UncompleteGuide wasn't ever used so I decided to remove it. Additionally I changed CompleteGuide to be an ApiEvent<Boolean> so it will work for uncompleting guides just like FavoriteGuide does.,
m,GUI: Fix access to deleted widget after rebuilding a dialog  The issue was with the focus or mouse widget as it may not be a direct child of the dialog (it may for example be a child of the tab widget in the options dialog) and removing a widget was not resetting the mouse of focus widget if that widget was not a direct child.,
m,"GUI: Change name of GUI-renderers to remove ~""16-bit~""",
m,GROOVIE: Use debugC() and debugCN() functions directly in script debug.  This removes the debugScript() wrapper which can now be implemented directly using the relevant debug function. This avoids the variadic debug functions being wrapped in a second layer of variadic function which is probably causing a significant overhead.,
m,Greatly simplified add contact process.  Removed ConfirmAddContactActivity only one side has to confirm now. After that messages can be sent immediately. The other side adds the contact when the first message is received.,

m,glide: Remove unneeded frameskipper method.,
m,gles2rice: Remove unneeded preprocessor symbol GLES_2.,
m,gles2rice: Add/remove code to match upstream.  **POSSIBLE DOWNSTREAM BEHAVIOR CHANGE**  These changes are apparently benign from my very limited testing. It would be good however to get a second opinion.  Render.cpp: - Video buffers can be saved to PNG file  TextureFilters.cpp: - Option flag is not lowered when hi-res textures fail to load.  Video.cpp: - Core API is used to test plugin version compatibility. - ReadScreen2 now populates some output variables.,
m,Give memchecks/breakpoints a consistent interface.  Removes the limit on max breakpoints and makes everything use accessors for both that look roughly the same.,
m,Gecko codes: Added parenthesis where they were needed.(thanks to glennrics and soren) Fixed a copy paste error with write & fill 8bit codes. Also forgot to remove a return false;.(some more codes should work (fixed issue 2968)) New Wiimote Plugin: Added emulated swinging.(seems to work) Changed the emulated calibration data to some nice values.

m,front/ae-bridge: Remove system.exit calls use normal activity cycle.  NOTE: On some versions of Android if you quit the game activity (to the play menu) and then resume/restart the game activity you will get a segfault (hard crash) as the game activity starts up.  I am intentionally committing this to demonstrate the need for native- side library loading and unloading.  If you load a native library through Java's System.loadLibrary function there is no way to unload it later.  This causes problems if the native code contains static variables with static initializers (which is the case for us).  On subsequent launches of the activity the old library instance is re- used rather than reloaded and the static variables are thus not re- initialized.  Thus you cannot reliably restart the activity in a fresh state.  To get around the problem we must load and unload the libraries on the native side using dlopen dlsym and dlclose.  For a great discussion see http://stackoverflow.com/q/10649119/254218  Upcoming commits will address this problem but I wanted to commit this version as a frame of reference for subsequent discussion.,

m,sprites clean up + less xscenes,
m,Split accessHandlerCallback into several functions.  Instead of having a big callback function doing almost everything to handle a request we split the code into several functions.  There are two new helper functions : - build_response that create a response object with correct headers set. - compress_content who compress the content if necessary.  All the different cases are handle by different functions : - handle_suggest - handle_skin - handle_search - handle_random - handle_content - handle_default  accesHandlerCallback now handle common stuff delegate to the handle_* functions everything else.  There is no special optimization made here. Only splitting code.,

m,Fixes #1451 and #1407 by standardizing the maximum width for bitmaps that we are adding to spans in the editor.  * Made all ImageHelper methods static. * Changed `getMaximumThumbnailWidth()` in EditPostContentFragment to accommodate for 48dp of padding on each side instead of where it was being calculated in ImageHelper.getThumbnailForWPImageSpan(). This allows ImageHelper.getScaledBitmapAtLongestSide to also use this to resize to the proper dimensions. This ensures that all bitmaps we are adding to the editor will be the correct size. * Removed getThumbnailWidth() method since it is no longer needed.,
m,Fixed width of post list on tablets also removed separate sw720dp post list layout,
m,Fixed VBeam emulation in interlaced mode removing the hacks in the audio timing. Fixed VBeam emulation in progressive scan mode. Retained the old VBeam speed hack.

The ~""old Adlib~"" property was set too late in the iMUSE player so the Adlib driver would always think the game was new. I've removed this property from the iMUSE player since it's only function appeared to be to pass it on to the Adlib player and now set it in the Adlib player directly instead.  Also removed some remaining ~""multi MIDI~"" traces from the iMUSE player that I believe were obsoleted by the aforementioned ~""multi MIDI~"" change.  svn-id: r15974",

m,Fix users erroneously receiving generic editing-related error messages.  Changes in the API library mean that routine editing issues such as blocks are now handled by throwing ApiExceptions. This caused users to receive generic messages if they tried to edit while blocked rather than a message that told them they're blocked.  This patch updates the error handling by migrating checks for routine editing issues to the onCatch method to handle them appropriately. Also removes the EditingException class as it is no longer useful.  Bug: T105930 Change-Id: Id64ee4e34bd3ab168be84a88c8532b74db5e86ab,

m,Fix review time counting and max timer display  The timer displayed during review will now stop counting up when it reaches the maximal answer time and will be highlighted red to indicate that it has reached its limit (the desktop client does both).  This commit also changes the technique used to account for a card's true review time after a pause and resume of the reviewer. The new technique shifts back the *current* time by the elapsed interval instead of trying to shift the original start time by the elapsed time.This prevents clock changes from impacting the elapsed time.  This resolves the long-standing negative review time bug for which there was a workaround in place and thus removed in this commit.,

,Some work on cleaning up the FrameAui code.  Primarily this fixes the debugger windows for the audio and video plugins.

,Some optimization on the pixel and vertex shader generators. As tested on Zelda TP these changes should be able to reduce the number of lines in the compiled pixel shader program by 20% to 30% for example from 38 lines to 28 lines after the generated cg/HLSL pixel shader compiled by the cg/HLSL compiler. These could means slightly faster rasterization on slower video cards.  Also fixed shader compilation errors for DX9 plugin by using correct pixel/vertex attribute names that are compatibile with DX9 HLSL shader compiler. Now the generated vertex or pixel shader programs will compile correctly in either OGL or DX9.  However DX9 plugin is still not fixed even though the shader programs can be compiled now.    git-svn-id: https://dolphin-emu.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@4113 8ced0084-cf51-0410-be5f-012b33b47a6e,

This was due to the SMUSH channel base class using new/delete to manage buffer but the imuse_channel and saud_channel classes which subclass and override this using malloc/free. The more C++ solution of moving all to new/delete was tried but the buffer is passed into a MemoryReadStream and free()'d there so all classes have been moved to malloc/free instead. This is not a critical problem as the buffers are byte primitive type anyway.  svn-id: r55660,
,SCUMM: Fix unused variable warnings,
,SCUMM: fix imuse bugs #1315950 and #761637  - Revert guesswork fix for bug #761637 which caused bug #1315950 - Add missing clear_queue() call to stopAllSounds_internal(). This is taken from INDY4 / MONKEY2 disasm. Someone with a SAMXMAX or DOTT disasm might want to check whether this is correct for these targets too. - Old FOA savegames saved after the Dr. Ubermann death scene (= during the ending sequence) will still be bugged since the messed up imuse trigger/command queue gets restored from the savegame.,
,SCUMM: Clean up CMS code some more.,
,SCUMM: ArrayHeader related cleanup  svn-id: r24395,
,SCUMM: Added ActorC64 subclass of Actor and added a note stating that _miscflags isn't currently stored (possibly breaking C64 save states). Also reordered some HE specific code  svn-id: r24923,
,"SCUMM: Add a ~""chained games manager~""  This replaces the somewhat ugly use of the config manager to store the chained games.",
,SCUMM/FM-TOWNS: fix palette and other graphics issues  This commit should fix at least the following bugs/feature requests: #1032859 #1252088 #1055391 #1315968 #1315938 #1742106 #812891. The FM-Towns version of Scumm games use a mixed graphics mode with 2 layers (one with 32767 colors and one with 16 colors). Among other things I have added a screen output class which emulates this  dual layer approach which allows specific hardware effects like enabling and disabling layers (e.g. in the voodoo priestess scene in MI1).  Old savegames (saved before this update) will load but youâll encounter palette glitches in the verb/inventory screen since the 16 color palette for layer 2 is not contained in your savegame. This will be true at least for version 5 games. Certain scene change actions (which require the verb/inventory part to be redrawn) might correct this (e.g. try looking at the treasure map in MI1 and closing it). Version 3 games should be okay since they use a static text palette which is never changed and which will be reset after loading a savegame.  This update requires a USE_RGB_COLORS setting for proper operation. 8 bit users will get a warning that theyâll have to expect palette glitches . Apart from that the engine in 8 bit mode should not only still work okay but also benefit from some of the other (non palette related) improvements (e.g. bug #1032859 should be fixed even in 8 bit mode).  Japanese font drawing hasnât been improved much yet. This will be a separate task.  svn-id: r52966,

Basically it didn't need to be as complex as it was and mostly the 'hard stuff' it was solving is actually fairly easily handled by the draw. So. Seems to be working fine. There are other little tweaks here and there as I test out the system. The renderers need to behave under density and zoom changes; so that would be the widths of things should scale properly and the look of some of them leave a bit to be desired. However it's the system that is now fully functional and work on the renderers can come later.  The main track draw seems pretty solid.,

This commit updates the URL formats in the tests then makes all of them parse properly.  It also changes the parsing technique leveraging java.net.URL's built-in parsing abilities to assist.  Also I plan on adding a lot more URL formats so the current code structure made it very difficult to add to.  So each service will be split out into its own section starting here.,
,Rework of the layout: separate the board and the status text,
,Rework of Dozuki site list (Fixes #58)  Now SiteListActivity does the API call and sets the list on the Dialog whenever it is needed.

,Redraw view when somtehing is delete.,
,redone layouting ans AppCompat switch implementation,
,Redo light.cpp.  Remake the light_decode_table.  The table starts out without pre-filled in values since those are always discarded by the code apparently. We calculate a pseudo curve with gamma power function and then apply a new adjustment table.  The adjustment table is setup to make the default gamma of 2.2 look decent: not too dark at light level 3 or so but too dark at 1 and below to be playable. The curve is much smoother than before and looks reasonable at the whole range offering a pleasant decay of light levels away from lights.  The `display_gamma` setting now actually does something logical: the game is darker at values below 2.2 and brighter at values above 2.2. At 3.0 the game is very bright but still has a good light scale. At 1.1 or so the bottom 5 light levels are virtually black but you can still see enough detail at light levels 7-8 so the range and spread is adequate.  I must add that my monitor is somewhat dark to begin with since I have a `hc` screen that doesn't dynamic range colors or try to pull up `black` pixels for me (it is tuned for accurate color and light levels) so this should look even better on more dynamic display tunings.,

Restricting multiple selection to diagonals makes it easy to get the selection I really wanted.,

Currently it only checks if the sum of outputs provided by server matches the balance.  Requires server changes (confs arg for all unspent outputs get_raw_unspent_output) which are deployed to testnet only for now.,

,Overhauled the login screen to follow more of a VIPER/MVP style approach and added support for loading states. UTs to follow,
,Overhauled how creates updates and deletes are sent back to Pinboard.  Now using built in sync adapter functionality.  When a bookmark is updated now the content provider triggers an upload only sync that syncs any pending changes to Pinboard.  This should result in more predictable operation during limited connectivity and low memory situations (issue that prompted change was for user who's bookmarks would not always save because the os would kill PinDroid too quickly after sharing a bookmark which would kill the running async task as well). Issue : 57,
,overhauled button pressed backStack behaviour...use a JS callback to let it work with JS calls,
,Overhaul of OS X real Wiimote support.  Fixes a number of problems including unreliable connection setup frequent disconnections busy-waiting and shutdown deadlocks.  Motion Plus and nunchuk hot swapping now work and Wiiuse does a small amount of queueing to prevent occasional dropped packets. The OS X bluetooth stack has no internal input buffering and while a worker thread can easily keep up with data coming from the Wiimote the rest of Dolphin can easily get behind if it is blocked by disk I/O or similar. Mostly the Wiimote protocol recovers from dropped packets but sometimes the Wiimote would get out of sync and send a disconnect. I wonder if the other platforms might benefit from a bit of queueing at this layer as well.  Still doesn't support multiple devices as I kept changing my mind about how best to do it. I only have one Wiimote anyway..  One improvement to the Wiimote plugin that would be really nice would be for the scan for new devices to operate continuously or periodically like on a real Wii rather than just for 5 seconds at startup..   git-svn-id: https://dolphin-emu.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@5640 8ced0084-cf51-0410-be5f-012b33b47a6e,
,Overhaul notifications system  Features: * Now displays the number of mentions that the user has not seen in the notification. * When no mentions are outstanding display which servers the user is connected to not the last message. * When more than one mention is outstanding display the names of the conversations with new mentions not just the last message received. * Notifications of mentions are suppressed if you're in the conversation at the time of the mention. * Notifications of mentions automatically clear when you bring up the conversation. * Vibrate notifications now generate the user's chosen default vibrate pattern not a hard-coded one. * Add ticker text to the notification that's displayed when the IRCService goes into the foreground instead of displaying a blank ticker.  To allow for all of this the implementation moves most of the details of generating the notification text into the IRCService which now exposes addNewMention() and notifyConnected()/notifyDisconnected() methods instead of the lower-level updateNotification().,
,Overhaul message header display to scale reasonably with font-size changes but not to waste lots of space unnecessarily.  The placement of loading and attachment icons may want additional love. I'm not sure where they might best be placed.,

This implementation keeps the item names perfectly aligned across various versions and devices. The size of the checkbox is pertained by setting its status to ~""invisible~"" instead of ~""gone~"".

Or rather new-ish because this one has been lying around in the 'unfinished' directory for a while and has now been finished up thanks to James Harvey putting in some effort and galvanising me to put in the rest. This is 'Pearl' an implementation of Nikoli's 'Masyu'.  The code in Loopy that generates a random loop along grid edges to use as the puzzle solution has been abstracted out into loopgen.[ch] so that Pearl can use it for its puzzle solutions too.

,New mechanism for automatic generation of the puzzle screenshots on the web which I hope will also end up being extended to generate both Windows and X icons for each individual puzzle. The mechanism is: for each puzzle there's a save file in the `icons' subdirectory showing a game state which I think is a decent illustration of the puzzle and then there's a nasty set of scripts which runs each puzzle binary loads that save file grabs a screenshot using xwd and munges it into shape.  In order to support this I've added two new options (--redo and --windowid) to all the GTK puzzles which I don't expect ever to be used outside the icons makefile. I've also added two more options (--load and --id) which force a GTK puzzle to treat its command-line option as a save file or as a game ID respectively (the previous behaviour was always to guess and sometimes it guessed wrong).

Since the filled-grid-generation stage of Unruly is implemented by repeatedly choosing a square and then calling the solver to fill in all its consequences simply adding a solver mode conditional on this flag is sufficient to do the whole of the interesting part of the job.

,NetPlay: Rework pad mapping  Pad mapping and the UI behind it is significantly confusing and has been confusing users since NetPlay was introduced.  As part of a large code cleanup to help NetPlay more stable introduce a better pad mapping system where local pad mapping is handled by the client. Now all the server and other clients know is which player have which controllers and the clients only know this so they can show the pad mapping in the UI; they don't do anything else with it.

,My background-erasing changes in r5996/r5997 caused trouble with the keyboard-control cursors and when I tried to fix those more wallpaper bubbles popped up elsewhere. Here's what I think is a proper fix: a comprehensive overhaul of the redraw code such that instead of tracking the cursor positions explicitly in the drawstate we instead track for each peg position whether or not a cursor is currently displayed at that position. So cursor erasing and cursor drawing become part of the main draw loop rather than a separate bit on the end.   git-svn-id: svn://svn.tartarus.org/sgt/puzzles@6006 cda61777-01e9-0310-a592-d414129be87e,

,Move popup layouts from LatinKeyboardBaseView to LatinKeyboardView  See issue 150.  Grumble. The original code is really confusing with its distinction between LatinKeyboardBaseView and the derived LatinKeyboardView - the former class is used for popups the latter for the regular keyboard view. Neither should be confused with the Keyboard/LatinKeyboard classes which represent abstract key grids for use by the keyboard views and the LatinIME and KeyboardSwitcher classes which tie them together.  Inexplicably the code for adding long-press popups is in LatinKeyboardBaseView even though only the regular keyboard should be doing this. Android doesn't permit popup windows to be opened from popup windows and due to unexpected default values apparently the base class decides to do so anyway.  This CL starts moving some of the code which should never be run for popup keyboards to LatinKeyboardView though this is messy to untangle.,
,Move pipe+fork+exec+read code into its own function.,
,Move pdf downloading logic to AsyncTask,
,Move pathfinder classes to cpp file  There is no need to put them into the header they are solely used inside the pathfinder.

This commit moves the pathfinder classes to the cpp file without modifications. Also the PATHFINDER_DEBUG macro gets moved to the cpp file and the PATHFINDER_CALC_TIME macro gets moved to a plce where it actually does work.,

These files are a branch from the prior pull request and hopefully will make everyone more comfortable about including the code. The altitude and speed displays all the bells and whistles - that can come later if needed.,
,Mines now follows the conventional approach of offering a completely blank grid until you make the first click; to ensure solubility it does not generate the mine layout until that click and then ensures it is solvable starting from that position.  This has involved three infrastructure changes:  - random.c now offers functions to encode and decode an entire random_state as a string - each puzzle's new_game() is now passed a pointer to the midend itself which most of them ignore - there's a function in the midend which a game can call back to _rewrite_ its current game description.  So Mines now has two entirely separate forms of game ID. One contains the generation-time parameters (n and unique) plus an encoding of a random_state; the other actually encodes the grid once it's been generated and also contains the initial click position. When called with the latter new_game() does plausibly normal stuff. When called with the former it notes down all the details and waits until the first square is opened and _then_ does the grid generation and updates the game description in the midend. So if _after_ your first click you decide you want to share this particular puzzle with someone else you can do that fine.  Also in this checkin the mine layout is no longer _copied_ between all the game_states on the undo chain. Instead it's in a separate structure and all game_states share a pointer to it - and the structure is reference-counted to ensure deallocation.   git-svn-id: svn://svn.tartarus.org/sgt/puzzles@5862 cda61777-01e9-0310-a592-d414129be87e,

,Menu Drawer: Changed drawer to use a ListView in order to better support setting the current row as selected.

,"Make plantlike drawtype more fun  Adds several new ways that the plantlike drawtype mesh can be changed.  This requires paramtype2 = ~""meshoptions~"" to be set in the node definition. The drawtype for these nodes should be ~""plantlike~"".  These modifications are all done using param2. This field is now a complex bitfield that allows some or more of the combinations to be chosen and the mesh draw code will choose the options based as neeeded for each plantlike node.  bit layout: bits 0 1 and 2 (values 0x1 through 0x7) are for choosing the plant mesh shape: 0 - ordinary plantlike plant (~""x~"" shaped) 1 - ordinary plant but rotated 45 degrees (~""+~"" shaped) 2 - a plant with 3 faces (~""*~"" shaped) 3 - a plant with 4 faces (~""#~"" shaped) 4 - a plant with 4 faces (~""#~"" shaped leaning outwards) 5 through 7 are unused and reserved for future mesh shapes.  bit 3 (0x8) causes the plant to be randomly offset in the xz plane. The plant should fall within the 1x1x1 nodebox if regularly sized.  bit 4 (0x10) causes the plant mesh to grow by sqrt(2) and will cause the plant mesh to fill out 1x1x1 and appear slightly larger. Texture makers will want to make their plant texture 23x16 pixels to have the best visual fit in 1x1x1 size.  bit 5 (0x20) causes each face of the plant to have a slight negative Y offset in position descending up to 0.125 downwards into the node below. Because this is per face this causes the plant model to be less symmetric.  bit 6 (0x40) through bit 7 (0x80) are unused and reserved for future use.  !(https://youtu.be/qWuI664krsI)",

,"LoginUtils.getCipher: Specify the modes and padding and specify good ones.  android-lint said: ~""Cipher.getInstance should not be called without setting the encryption mode and padding.~"" so I used the example transformation (algorithm/mode/padding) mentioned here: http://developer.android.com/reference/javax/crypto/Cipher.html  This also meant having to get the initialization vector used during encryption to provide it when doing the decryption. We use a new initialization vector for every encryption of every message.  It was interesting to do this (apparently) correctly but note that encrypted the authentication details is still mostly pointless and unnecessary anyway because we already store them (and the encryption key and initialization vector) in private SharedPreferences anyway. If someone has root access to the device then they will still be able to get the unencrypted text - it's just a bit more difficult. A secret key that's hard-coded in the source code might be a little more secure but even that could be obtained from the app's executable.",

,JitArm64: Merge ps_sumX.,
,JitArm64: Avoid MOVI2R is possible.  Just use all kind of ADDI2R SUBI2R ... They have some optimizations internally.,
,JitArm64: ADDI2R optimizations 2.,
,JIT64: optimize carry calculations  Omit carry calculations that get overwritten later in the block before they're used. Very common in the case of srawix and friends.,
,Jit64: Add a switch for easier fallback to the C++ dispatcher.,
,JIT: simplify ISI handling.  When we try to JIT from a block which doesn't exist don't JIT any code; just update the PPC state to indicate an ISI.  This is a little simpler and avoids abusing the JIT block cache.,
,jit: Minor cleanups.,
,"JIT: flush a register if it won't be used for the rest of the block  This should dramatically reduce code size in the case of blocks with lots of branches and certainly doesn't hurt elsewhere either.  This can probably be improved a good bit through smarter tracking of register usage e.g. discarding registers that are going to be overwritten but this is a good start and should help reduce code size and register pressure. Unlike that sort of change this is a ~""safe~"" patch; it only flushes registers which can't affect correctness unlike actually discarding data.  As part of this refactor PPCAnalyst to support distinguishing between float and integer registers (to properly handle instructions that access both like floating-point loads and stores).  Also update every instruction in the interpreter flags table I could find that didn't have all the correct flags.",
,JIT: faster PPC_FP code  The PPC_FP conversion code can be made a lot simpler with the observation that the only values that need to be sent through the slow x87 path are denormals.  A whole bunch faster: 708->678 seconds on POV-RAY.,

,"I've reorganized the repo a bit.  I've also assumed we'll be using the program name of ~""OmniDroid~"" since that seemed to be the most popular (if we want to revist the name we can discuss on Monday).  I've moved the sandboxes so if you're developing in your sandobx you'll need to note that it's moved in the repo and you'll need to drop it in the proper place now.  Here are the explanations for the changes:   /sp09-google/trunk - Contains just our most recent development code that is required to build the app if someone wants to build our app from scratch this is all that they would checkout from us.  /sp09-google/branches - If you're working on a development branch from the original source but you're code isn't ready to be merged back into the trunk yet.  /sp09-google/tags - When we put out release versions we can tag that sepcific version of the code for release.  /sp09-google/tools - Tools are generally things that we might have created for use in our development environment (examples: configurations files for eclipse/cruise control/etc.)  /sp09-google/vendor - Downloaded packages that we might be using in our development such as cruise control for automated build checks etc.  /sp09-google/sandbox - An area for code that each of us might just be tinkering with (I don't think we want these in trunk becuase outside users shouldn't see these when they checkout the trunk.)",

Now it can be treated as another activity and can be mark as preferred activity but only for text/* and some text mime/types. For undefined mime/types categories the internal editor is still used in a non preferred mode (internal editor cannot be marked as preferred) * When the internal editor in a non preferred mode is selected 'remember' checkbox is hidden. * Improve preferred activity resolution * Allow clear a preferred activity on the open with dialog (when 'remember' checkbox is unchecked) * For better compatibility the internal editor now ignores the ACTION_EDIT action so opened files are always editables (with the exception of binary files that they are opened always as read-only) * Improved onIntentSelected with better NPE and internal editor checks  Change-Id: Ie42990a6c0ccbdd4bfab6ec23ae27cc808cac7b7",

IOS stores the active title in a structure like this:  struct ESTitleContext { Ticket* ticket; TMD* tmd; u32 active; };  With this commit we also do keep the Ticket and TMD around. This makes some of the DI ioctlvs (which return data about the current active title) trivial to implement in the future.  This fixes the System Menu not being able to see update partitions and also allows us to change Dolphin's active game info in the future.,

I always said that was an ugly loop and really ought to arise naturally as a special case of something more believable and here it is.  The practical upshot is that Hard mode has just become slightly harder: some grids generated by the new Slant will be unsolvable by the old one's solver. I don't think it's become _excessively_ more hard; I think I'm happy with the new difficulty level. (In particular I don't think the new level is sufficiently harder than the old to make it worth preserving the old one as Medium or anything like that.)  [originally from svn r6591],

,Improvements to front-end modals on exception handling managing intelligence and feed titles.,
,Improvements to filled-grid generation. Introduced a cunning idea suggested by IWJ last night: grid generation can immediately choose an entire grid row randomly since all that's doing is nailing down the names of the numbers and that gets the whole thing started more efficiently. But the main difference is that now grid generation is given only area^2 steps to come up with a filled grid and then cut off unceremoniously causing grid generation to fail and be retried from scratch. This seems to prevent hangups on jigsaw layouts that admit few useful solutions by changing layout constantly. 9j puzzles now generate at a sensible rate and as an added bonus so do 5x5 normal puzzles which they never used to.   git-svn-id: svn://svn.tartarus.org/sgt/puzzles@7978 cda61777-01e9-0310-a592-d414129be87e,

,Improved transitions and replaced actionbar with toolbar,
,Improved theme scrolling performance,

,Improved the way the AddFeedActivity is waiting for the download to finish,
,Improved the interface of Sprite and Animation concerning relative coordinates and scaling.  It is no longer needed to modify the underlying animations when drawing them on the screen or testing pixels in them.  Read access is enough because the displacement of the object is passed as a parameter.  Added some more const's where they logically belong.  svn-id: r44419,
,Improved the documentation,
,Improved tabs UI,
,Improved synchronization timing and WakeLock algorithm.  This new approach should guarantee that the syncing never stalls just because a single attempt exceeds the (currently 10 minute) WakeLock timeout.  At the sync frequency K-9 will wakeup again and refresh the WakeLock for another go at syncing.  This should make synchronization much more reliable in the face of slow or unavailable connections in particular ones which hit the socket read timeouts.  Also fixed the audible notifications so that the ringtone selected is always for one of the accounts with new unread mail.  Developers now have the option to turn on a fast-flashing LED during synchronization in order to observe whether synchronization is happening while the handset is apparently asleep.  I think this option would be aggravating to non-developer users.  See Email.NOTIFICATION_LED_WHILE_SYNCING   Issue 175 Issue 170,

,"improve status-bar notifications for ICS and also Honeycomb  Legibility greatly improved appropriate colours are used to match ordinary notifications:  * ICS - the new Notification.Builder and the default notification layout are used.

Targeting ICS will have to wait until ABS support is in:  ~""Applications targeting [14] or a later release will get these new changes in behavior: For devices without a dedicated menu key the software compatibility menu key will not be shown even on phones.

,Hygiene: Clean up misuse of PageTitles in GalleryActivity  The logger expects a PageTitle object coming from the gallery activity but we may not be in the context of wiki page since the gallery can now also be launched from the feed featured image card.  An earlier commit introduced the idea of keeping around a placeholder PageTitle for logging purposes in the event we're coming from the feed featured image card.  But storing this in the pageTitle member variable is a bad idea since this makes creates a risk it'll end up getting inappropriately passed to the content model for the page data client or inserted into the cache.  This patch eliminates such use of the PageTitle class and updates downstream usages of the PageTitle object as need.  To follow up: figure out a good way to pass the featured image date through to the gallery for use in a share subject.  A FeaturedImageGalleryItem subclass would likely be appropriate here.

[originally from svn r6041],
,general code clean up,
,General cleanup to 3D Vision hack fits in more with the Dolphin coding style now. Also fixed the crash that would occur when using a mouse button with 3D Vision enabled.

,FSFragment: Fix warnings.,
,front: Vastly simplify the crc lookup for building the cheats menu.  At least on my Nexus 7 the expensive part is parsing the cheats data and building the cheats menu not computing the crc.,
,front: Updated peripheral info added cpu/periph info to crash report.,
,front: Tweak some styling for player map preference.,
,front: Throw IOExceptions from CheatSection/CheatBlock constructors.  Let the top-level ConfigFile class deal with the exceptions the way it does in the save() method.,
,front: Split long-click handler into functions.  Easier to read more encapsulated easier to modularize later.,
,front: Simplify some code.  I found the OnCustomLayout name confusing since it wasn't called on layout but rather when the dialog closed.  You get pretty much the same calling simplicity by making Prompt.prefillBuilder public so Prompt.promptCustomLayout seems kind of overkill.  Feel free to debate...,
,front: Simplify RomDetail constructor (no functional changes).,
,front: Simplified some mechanics in CoreInterface and cleaned up a bit.  Audio thread is killed after emulator shuts down. Audio thread is killed before a new audio thread is started in case the last thread wasn't killed properly.  Eliminated some functions by simplifying some code.  Changed some variable/method names for more consistency/clarity.,
,front: Search ROMs download art in same task for simplicity.  Also add a few sanity checks before downloading.  We can always separate the tasks later if necessary.  For now KISS.,
,"front: Replaced InputMapPreference with InputMapActivity.  Controller enabled/disabled is persisted as its own boolean now rather than being serialized with the input map. This is much more logical and easier to maintain in the long run.  Fewer buttons/axes are mapped by default now to minimize conflicts out of the box.  They are - analog stick <-> AXIS_X and AXIS_Y - d-pad <-> KEY_DPAD_* (no AXIS_HAT_* conflicts w/ Nyko PlayPad) - start R L buttons to their virtually universal keycodes  A TogglePreference was implemented.  Basically a fancier version of a checkbox preference.  Besides the slider/toggle widget the main difference is that clicking on the list item in the preference menu does not do anything (checkbox preference it toggles the check state). This is so that you can handle the click in your own custom way e.g. to launch an activity like InputMapActivity.  To change widget state you need to click on the widget itself. This imitates the ~""master on/ off switch~"" pattern used in the Android settings: http://developer.android.com/design/patterns/settings.html",
,front: Move front menu items up to the action bar.  Should make it a little easier to start working on the version 3 front screen (carousel/gallery).,
,front: Move download function to utility class for reuse.,
,front: Move Audio settings to Advanced menu.,
,front: Implemented virtual gamepad scaling I added two new optional parameters to the INFO section of pad.ini for virtual gamepad layouts.  These parameters specify the intended width in both pixels and inches.  The auto-scaling uses these to adjust image sizes to the target device.  This is still pretty rough but the basic functionality is in place.  The default pixelWidth and inchWidth for the gamepad layouts will likely need to be adjusted (I based the numbers off of my old Droid X just to make sure the auto-scaling was working).  I haven't implemented separate logic for Tablets or portrait modes yet.,
,front: Implement basic gridview gallery for initial alpha testing.  This is just a stand-in until the fancy gallery is implemented so it doesn't need to be perfect.  I started with multiple columns but then it looked weird on smaller devices.  Rather than port to a LinearLayout I just kept the GridView and made it a single column.,
,front: Consolidate controller/analog/device info into single popup.,
,front: Completely rewrite GL context management in GameSurface.  Contexts and surfaces can be re-used and re-bound if possible.  These capabilities aren't being fully exercised... yet.,

,From the changelog: - Bugfix: Don't assume OSS is installed in all linux systems. - Bugfix: Some combinations of VolumeSetLevel and VolumeMute caused VolumeGetString to return Mute when not muted - Make SDL volume handling the default since OSS is no longer included in the kernel. - Minor refactoring of volume handling code.  Personally I would drop OSS support altogether since it's deprecated (and some 'user-friendly' distros don't have it enabled by default e.g. Ubuntu) and it changes the master volume level and 'remembers' it when muted (what if two programs did this?).,

,Framework alteration: we now support a `game_ui' structure in addition to the `game_state'. The new structure is intended to contain ephemeral data pertaining to the game's user interface rather than the actual game: things stored in the UI structure are not restored in an Undo for example. make_move() is passed the UI to modify as it wishes; it is now allowed to return the _same_ game_state it was passed to indicate that although no move has been made there has been a UI operation requiring a redraw.   git-svn-id: svn://svn.tartarus.org/sgt/puzzles@4207 cda61777-01e9-0310-a592-d414129be87e,

Git can normalize line endings for specific files and avoid this problem. Binary files should be marked to avoid accidentally normalization.,

The issue is that it this change casts wxConvCurrent (which is a wxMBConvLibc) to a wxCSConv. This is an unsafe cast because wxCSConv has member variables but wxMBConvLibc does not.  In LogWindow.cpp the constructor for m_SJISConv is dereferencing one of those member variables which is a dereference of uninitialized memory!  This CL reverts to the older (non-crashing) constructor but keeps the behavior the same.,

,Fix GTK puzzle resizing *again*.  Jonas KÃ¶lker points out that commit a800ff16b (which fixed a bug in the previous attempt) left in another bug: if the puzzle size was changed while the window was maximised the system would fail to recompute the tile size and would redraw completely wrongly.  So it's not optional after all to run midend_size() even if the drawing area size hasn't changed. I've reverted that code to be unconditional and now only the refresh of the Cairo-side backing store system is conditionalised - and that's conditionalised on changes to either the size of the actual window _or_ the size of the contained pixmap. (The latter should defend against redraw failure in the case where the puzzle aspect ratio changes so that neither the window size nor the tile size changes but a recentre is still needed.)  I _think_ this now fixes all the cases of resizing: this time I've tested making an unmaximised puzzle window bigger or smaller and within a maximised window forcing the puzzle to scale up scale down or change its aspect ratio without changing its tile size. All work on GTK2 and GTK3 and yet we still don't get the visible flicker on status line updates that was the reason I started fiddling with this code in the first place.  (We _do_ still call configure_area on every update of the status line at least under GTK3; that's going to cause a forced full redraw on every timer tick in Mines which is wasteful of CPU so it would still be nice to find a better way of identifying the cases in which no resizing at all was necessary and we could avoid renewing the game drawstate. But the current code at least doesn't have any display _errors_ that I know of which is an improvement on its previous state.),

This completes the decoupling of the search-related fragments from anything having to do with expecting a parent activity and instead using callback mechanisms.  The only thing that remains an indirect depenency on MainActivity is the setSearchViewEnabled function which expects a specific view hierarchy inside the activity's toolbar.

,Finally elminiated that pesky bug where the app would run in the background even after the app was paused.  Pausing the app would disable the shake listener but the animation thread wasn't finished running then the callback would re-enable the shake listener even though the app dropped to the background.  Solved this by a stricter management of the onClick/shake listeners during pause/resume and removing shake listener callbacks onPause.  Also made a separate settings.xml file for v14+ devices which uses the fancy SwitchPreference instead of CheckBoxPreference.  Bumped version to v5.5 for the Play Store.,

ClientEnvironment doesn't use player list anymore it only contains the local player as addPlayer is only called from Client constructor client side.

,Ensure on-disk passwords are unencrypted  This is a step towards removing password encryption alltogether.  The background is that it's broken on Androin Nougat anyway and that it didn't provide any extra security before that either.  Since Bankdroid needs to send plain text passwords to the banks it must be possible to retrieve the plain text passwords automatically. And if the passwords are encrypted on disk Bankdroid needs to have the key. And if Bankdroid stores both the key and the encrypted password on the phone a determined attacker could get both anyway and the encryption is useless.  The only thing the encryption has protected against is a user rooting their own device and retrieving their own plain text passwords. This would enable the attacker to read their own account balance from the bank.  Which they likely already could even before this change...  This change also disables an Android Lint check whose outcome changes over time; these checks are impossible to maintain. And we fixed some warnings.,

,enhancement of costuom paths preferences,
,Enhanced PathPreference implementation (more portable more robust)  The default values are provided in the XML file now rather than in the java code making this much more modular and general. Also provides two options for handling non-existent path (e.g. fresh install user moved the file/directory): 1 - Fall-back to the external storage directory (default) 2 - Create the parent directories needed to make the path exist  The former is useful for directories the app will be reading from (e.g. a directory for user-provided inputs where the user may have moved the files between sessions).  The latter is useful for directories that the app will be writing to (e.g. a directory for cache files where the dev wants to ensure the app doesn't clutter the storage root).,
,Enhanced MMS configuration prompts and processing.  1) Added a new message status to MmsDatabase to signify a pending MMS download which requires APN settings.  2) Added a database method to query MMS messages based on status.  3) Added login to SendReceiveService for processing of MMS pending APN information.  4) Moved all APN/MMS settings into ApnPreferencesActivity and transformed PromptApnActivity into a simple informational activity.  5) Added logic to check for APN settings on send and receive of all MMS (media group email) and direct user to PromptApnActivity then ApnPreferencesActivity if necessary.  6) Vocab/grammar adjustments.,

,"eclipse: Remove project metafiles *SEE COMMIT MESSAGE*.  These files don't belong in the git repository since they are user- specific and subject to change based on eclipse version.  After merging this commit you will need to regenerate your own version of these files.  Here's how:  1. In eclipse ~""Delete~"" the project from your workspace (but don't delete the actual files) 2. Close eclipse and manually delete the above three files (if they aren't already) 3. Open eclipse and File->Import... ~""Existing Android Code Into Workspace~"" 4. Right-click project->Android Tools->Fix Project Properties 5. Right-click project->Android Tools->Add Native Support... a. Enter name ~""Dummy~"" and click Finish b. Manually delete jni/Dummy.cpp 6. If you want multi-core compilation (dramatically faster builds) go to Project->Properties->C/C++ Build a. Uncheck ~""Use default build command~"" b. Set build command to ii.  ~""ndk-build -j3~"" if your build machine runs 2 cores i.   ~""ndk-build -j6~"" for 4 cores iii. ~""ndk-build -j12~"" for 8 cores iv.  etc. 7. For auto-formatting the Java code (ctrl-shift-f) be sure to import the formatting settings located in ./doc/config_files/  When this is all done the C/C++ indexer should work properly and resolve #includes correctly.  The drawback (besides the initial recreation) is that you'll have to redo this process every time you jump to an old revision where the files are tracked then jump back to the newer revision.  The easy solution to this is to just back up your untracked files and restore them every time git deletes them after the reset.",

If all accounts are set not to sync via the sync handler then syncing is disabled. If at least one account is set to sync then syncing is enabled. When the user enables an account (LoginActivity) we enable syncing to match the master setting when they disable the account we disable syncing.,

,DRASCULA: Remove delays when showing and hiding the inventory  I don't see any purpose to this delays and they were not present in the original engine. It works fine without those and the interface seems more responsive.  This fixes bug #7121 DRASCULA: Delay and freeze when pressing right mouse click on game  Also move a delay when left clicking to after performing the action. With the delay between the left click and the action the mouse position could have moved when performing the action resulting in the wrong action being performed (e.g. activating the wrong verb or picking the wrong object in the inventory). But removing the delay altogether causes flickering when picking objects from the inventory.,
,DRASCULA: Fixed Code to allow Quit/RTL Function and avoid Memory Leakage.  A memory leakage was traced down to a failure to call the engine destructor. This was due to the engine directly calling OSystem quit() i.e. _system->quit() rather than just allowing engine::run() to return. Have removed this code and implemented the changes required to allow graceful Quit/RTL to occur.  svn-id: r55583,

,Don't fail rebuild when header is removed  The *.d depends files for make just list the files used when building an object file. Removing a file listed in such a dependency file causes make to search for a way to recreate it. This usually cannot work because these files aren't autogenerated.  The gcc option -MP can be used to generate empty rule for these files. Removing a file in a dependency list will then execute this empty rule and continue with the execution of the creation of the object file. This compilation process will then automatically correct the dependency file.,

,dmix: MPDStatus (as returned from MPD) can no longer be null.  MPDStatus as returned from MPD().getStatus() used to double as a status update method. This caused all callers to require null checking and error handling in the case that a status refresh was required. This commit uses StatusMontior callbacks to keep completely updated from connection to updates.  This also adds the method MPDStatus().isValid() to check status object validity since this was typically done as a null check when previously required.,

,Did a big refactoring on the MonochromeBitmapSource. I removed all the caching luminance calls and converted them to getting luminance data on demand. This saved another 33000 function calls per rejected scan good for another 15 ms savings. I also moved the luminance calls to BaseMonochromeBitmapSource and made them protected to indicate that the decoders shouldn't use them.  Overall the recent optimizations took one rejected scan from 307 to 135 ms which is definitely noticeable.  WARNING: I am not able to build the Bug or J2ME clients but I believe they are correct.  git-svn-id: https://zxing.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@656 59b500cc-1b3d-0410-9834-0bbf25fbcc57,

After This patch the daemon removes FIFOs as soon as the client is connected. (This is detected by making the daemon read from the control socket.)  This patch becomes unnecessary when file descriptors can be passed though processes.,

,"Crafting speedup  This greatly increases crafting performance especially in worlds with many mods.  Approved by @kwolekr.  Introduces a hash-type-layered fall-through mechanism where every layer specifies one hash algorithm and the ~""deeper the fall~"" the more collisions to expect for the algorithm. One Craft definition only resides at one layer which improves speed for lower layers (and a complete fail) due to most craft definitions residing at high layers.  Due to the fall-through design the undocumented behaviour that later craft recipes override older ones had to be weaked up a bit but craft recipes with the same hash and layer will still override.",

,Core/DSP: Split extended opcode 0xc0/mask 0xc0 to account for 0xc3/mask 0xc3 variant  In assembly these are 'ld $ax0.d$ax1.r@$arS with their nm and nm variants which have been special cased for S==3. The regular 'ld can be decomposed into lrri $ax0.d@$arS and lrri $ax1.r@$ar3 while the S==3 case decomposes to lrri $axR.h@$arD and lrri $axR.l@$ar3. The latter variant will be disassembled to 'ldax $axR@$arD after this change. The assembler recognizes both the new 'ldax variant and the old 'ld with @$ar3 but the disassembler only outputs 'ldax. Besides the readability this allows for more correct register use analysis(when it's done).   git-svn-id: https://dolphin-emu.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@7413 8ced0084-cf51-0410-be5f-012b33b47a6e,
,Core/Core/HW: Give small amounts of time to the dsp whenever the ppc reads the high bits from the mailbox registers. It is probably waiting for the dsp to read the data from the cpu-to-dsp mailbox or for the dsp to write to the dsp-to-cpu mailbox.  This about removes DSP::Read16 from lle profiles where it previously used up to 2% of all system time. Also speeds up games quiet a bit.   git-svn-id: https://dolphin-emu.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@6719 8ced0084-cf51-0410-be5f-012b33b47a6e,
,Core updates:  - Move internal parameters from (public) m64p_rom_settings to (private) rom_params. Also keep ROM_HEADER around (as m64p_rom_header) mostly for future use.  - Remove unnecessary temporal variables from parse_md5.  - Use NULL instead of empty_entry (which is not used anywhere).  - Remove local ROM_HEADER which made the global be NULL. Join the INI parsers on config.c and rom.c which clarifies romdatabase_open a bit. Also remove g_romdatabase.comment since it only signaled the database creation and required several dynamic allocations. Fix two undefined behaviour bugs on romdatabase_open: One call to snprintf with overlapping buffers (while generating g_romdatabase.comment) and a malloc call whose size is potentially zero which potentally returned NULL and crashed the program (on GoodName handling).  - Add a new ROM_PARAMS.aidacrate field and simplify write_ai* functions. This also adds partial support for the MPAL system type (which has no corresponding country code yet).  - Simplify hexconvert.  - Fix M64CMD_ROM_GET_HEADER if the frontend doesn't request the full header,
,Core update.  From main repo:  - Initial attempt to make the savestate code endian-independent compiler-independent and detach it from the emulator's internal representation. So far only the code to read savestates has been modified. There's no error checking yet but should be easy to add. A test to load a savestate from another endianness has been successful. There has been a noticeable file size increment but there's hardly any way to avoid it. I expect to be able to remove some code from other parts of the emulator once this task has been completed and structures can be modified freely.,

,Convert remaining HttpURLConnection usages to OkHttp  Most of our core API calls already use the up-to-date Request/Response API provided by OkHttp.

We won't be able to completely do away with OkUrlFactory until we stop using the apps/android/java-mwapi library which needs the cookie handling that the OkHttpClient provides.  (In principle we could put together our own implementation but it's really not worth the trouble.)  Removing our reliance on apps/android/java-mwapi will be in a patch to follow.

,Conversation with Richard and Chris yesterday gave rise to a more sensible means of generating an initial gridful of rectangles. This was previously a stupidly non-scalable bit of the Rectangles puzzle generator: it filled a ludicrously large array with every possible rectangle that could go anywhere in the grid picked one at random and winnowed the list by removing anything that overlapped that one then repeated until the list was empty (and therefore the grid was full except for remaining singleton squares). Total cost was O(N^4) in both time and space; not pretty.  Richard and Chris's sensible alternative was to place each rectangle by randomly choosing a so-far-uncovered _square_ and then picking a random rectangle from the possible ones covering that square. This means we only have to deal with a small fragment of the rectangle list at any one time and we don't have to store the whole lot in memory; so it's _much_ faster and more scalable and has virtually no memory cost.  A side effect of this algorithmic change is that the probability distribution has altered. When you line up all the possible _rectangles_ and pick one at random then obviously the small ones are going to be in the majority since lots of small ones can fit into the space taken up by any given big one. So the original algorithm tends to favour fiddly grids full of lots of tiny rectangles which don't tend to be very interesting. But if you first pick a square and then think about the rectangles that can surround that square the small ones are suddenly going to be in the _minority_ because there are only two ways you can place (say) a 2x1 containing a given square compared to 36 ways you can place a 6x6. So this algorithm favours more large rectangles which I generally consider to be an improvement.  [originally from svn r5982],

This gets compatilibity for example with the contacts app when a user try to set the image of a contact. * Detect android.provider.MediaStore.Audio.Media.EXTRA_MAX_BYTES; when this extra is present the PickerActivity only display (and allow select) files with a size lower than requested. * Detect Intent.EXTRA_LOCAL_ONLY; useless until CMFM allow access remote file systems.

,CLOUD: Simplify OneDriveTokenRefresher  It now just extends CurlJsonRequest not wraps one.,

,Client handlers: Remove useless stringstream usage in two handlers (#5510),
,Client & ClientEnvirnment: don't create fake events (#5676)  Instead of create fake events on the stack on each loop call (Game::run) verify is queue is empty or not and handle event directly if there is.  This prevents fake ClientEvent creation & memory allocations  Same fix is also applied on ClientEnvironment & rename getClientEvent to getClientEnvEvent to match ClientEnvEvent object,

,Cleanup: removed GameActivity dependency,
,Cleanup: remove the game_state parameter to game_colours(). No game was actually using it and also it wasn't being called again for different game states or different game parameters so it would have been a mistake to depend on anything in that game state. Games are now expected to commit in advance to a single fixed list of all the colours they will ever need which was the case in practice already and simplifies any later port to a colour-poor platform. Also this change has removed a lot of unnecessary faff from midend_colours().  [originally from svn r6416],

,Cleanup: relieve frontends of the duty to call midend_rewrite_statusbar() and check the result against the last string returned. This is now done centrally in drawing.c and the front end status bar function need only do what it says on the tin.  While I'm modifying the prototype of drawing_init() I've also renamed it drawing_new() for the same reason as random_new() (it _allocates_ a drawing object rather than just initialising one passed in).

ScummVM doesn't do that but it's a nice image that I wish we could do something useful with and it's easier to have the code here for reference than having to dig through old revisions of the resource manager.  svn-id: r17894",

,"Changes to allow LoadCPReg to work in a preprocess mode which affects a separate state.  This state will be used to calculate sizes for skipping over commands on a separate thread.  An alternative to having these state variables would be to have the preprocessor stash ~""state as we go~"" somewhere but I think that would be much uglier.  GetVertexSize now takes an extra argument to determine which state to use as does FifoCommandRunnable which calls it.  While I'm modifying FifoCommandRunnable I also change it to take a buffer and size as parameters rather than using g_pVideoData which will also be necessary later.  I also get rid of an unused overload.",

For more information on /permissive- see our blog https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/vcblog/2016/11/16/permissive-switch/.  These changes are to address 3 different types of issues:  1) Use of qualified names in member declarations  struct A { void A::f() { } // error C4596: illegal qualified name in member declaration // remove redundant 'A::' to fix };  2) Binding a non-const reference to a temporary  struct S{};  // If arg is in 'in' parameter then it should be made const. void func(S& arg){}  int main() { //error C2664: 'void func(S &)': cannot convert argument 1 from 'S' to 'S &' //note: A non-const reference may only be bound to an lvalue func( S() );  //Work around this by creating a local and using it to call the function S s; func( s ); }  3) Add missing #include <intrin.h>  Because of the workaround you are using in the code you will need to include this.

,Bugfix: Current Track disappeared when starting point wandered offscreen  The 'bounds' that I had implemeted earlier described the minimal rectangle inside which a whole track was contained. This bounding rectangle was used to quickly cull all track types at draw-time. And it worked well... too well!  The current track is continually adding points to itself so its bounds need to be recalculated regularly not just at startup like other track types.  So I've implemented a new Renderable 'CurrentTrack' which does the special handling for that type of track. It is smart in that it only recalculates/updates bounding rectangle on the newly added points so it's very quick. I tested it on my phone and it appears to be working OK.  Other minor adjustments here and there as I tweak things.,

AutoSaves are stored in a subdirectory of the user-specified game-save directory (like slot saves and manual saves).  Also changed the name of the auto-save file to be the name of the ROM rather than hash code.  That way if the user moves the ROM folder the linkage to the auto-savefile isn't lost.,

,AUDIO: Simplify RawStream code.  This drops the (unused) ability to play based on a list of input blocks. This was formely only used by the NDS specific VOC streaming code which has been removed in 9fa9f68789ef51e078cb8631e06bead13cae13f2.,

But MidiParser really only needs a tiny subset of the MidiDriver capabilities namely those found in MidiDriver_BASE. So we try to subclass from that whenever possible; this allows us to remove many stub methods and enables further future simplifications.",

,Anonymous users will see a warning on sending an email. Also removing FeedIcon model (having switched to the mongo MFeedIcon model).,
,Annoying special cases for Mines.  Firstly the `Restart' function now reconstructs an initial game state from the game description rather than dup_game(states[0]). This means that Restart in a game of Mines restarts to just _after_ the initial click so you can resume the puzzle-solving part without having to remember where you placed that click.  Secondly the midend now contains a second `private' game desc which is guaranteed to actually reconstruct the initial game_state correctly (which Mines's publicly visible game descs tend not to since they describe a state which has already had the first click). This should make serialising of Mines more sensible.  [originally from svn r6025],

,Aha this seems to be a more sensible way of getting screenshots: instead of having the puzzle binary export its window ID to a script which then runs xwd we can use the gdk-pixbuf library to have the puzzle binary _itself_ read its own internal pixmap and save it straight to a PNG. How handy. And faster and less timing-sensitive.  [originally from svn r7022],

,ae-bridge: Remove sdlQuit function (use emuStop instead).  Calling the core command (emuStop) is the most direct way to exit the core's main loop and is the approach used by the upstream ui-console (what we call 'front-end') library. Calling sdlQuit is just a round- about way of achieving the same thing and is not used anywhere else.,
,ae-bridge: Remove obsolete functions.,
,ae-bridge: Fix regression where launch crashed after settings changed.  This commit effectively reverts a regression tracked down to commit 2e4f3c70c477a1ac96745d061f141af2066d8a97  Somehow the order of loading (input-android vs other libraries) and/or the thread from which they are loaded makes a difference.  The bug can be reproduced by launching emulator quitting changing a user setting (e.g. audio plugin) then relaunching the emulator.  The app would crash hard due to a segfault.  The crash only occurred when a user setting was changed; never occurred if the settings didn't change.,

,Add map button,
,Add lv translation  + fix download layout,
,Add long-press menu to Search Nearby Disambig and Read More.  Generalized the PageLongPressHandler to be usable by a ListView in addition to a generic View. In the case of a ListView we automatically give it an OnItemLongClickListener that handles the long-press event.  Because the standard ListView doesn't provide the x-y coordinates of the long-press event I created WikiListView where it records the last known x-y position from monitoring touch events.  Made BottomDialog inherit from AppCompatDialog and turned some of its initialization code into styles.  Did NOT add the long-press menu to History and Saved Pages since they already have a long-press action (to select multiple items for deletion). We'll need to think about that part a bit further (future patch).  Bug: T103957 Change-Id: Ibbf613bfb50435f643787430da590621181f1d1b,

I've added this test because I recently unwittingly broke the Org switcher with 6708c75- the associated code is fragile and I'd like to make sure I don't break it again! I'm a little concerned that the integration test itself might be rather brittle but time will tell on that front...  This commit includes a tweak to cope with pre-ICS Spinner by ABS: Instead of android.widget.Spinner ABS uses 'com.actionbarsherlock.internal.widget.IcsSpinner' for the actionbar dropdown on pre-ICS devices so the integration test was failing to find the dropdown on pre-ics devices.,

,"Add continue reading card logic  â¢ Add continue reading card.  The continue reading card is populated with the most recent article from history when it's a day old+ and wasn't just dismissed. The check is initiated when the FeedFragment is resumed. Any previous continue reading card is removed from the Feed card list and a new one is added if available. The Feed card list may be owned by a greater coordinator later. You can try out the new continue reading card by hardcoding ContinueReadingCard.daysOld() to return 1.  The nasty disk IO stuff is in ContinueReadingClient. This class leverages LastPageReadTask which is pretty similar to MainPageReadMoreTopicTask.  The simple coordination state machine (literally just checks the age of the most recently viewed article and that it wasn't just dismissed) is in ContinueReadingCoordinator.  ContinueReadingCard is just a simple wrapper around a HistoryEntry. Its existence is justified because everything expects a Card and both ContinueReadingCoordinator and ContinueReadingCardView care about the card age (in days).  For the ContinueReadingCardView subtitle ~""x days ago~"" use Android plural strings. According to T47695 TWN supports this.  The FeedView's RecyclerView.Adapter is now a distinct file FeedRecyclerAdapter. It was getting big difficult to think about and was completely static. There's some manual type checks in this file instead of polymorphism that may want for revision.  â¢ Move the demo code to a demo package. The demo part of ListCard is now a ListCard subclass IntegerListCard. This code is still useful for testing and verifying disjoint cards work well. It will probably be removed soon.

To remove this requirement this change checks if there are any activities available on the system which can look in the file system. If there are new options for importing data will be available.  In addition the import/export activity's layout was updated adding more explanation.  Finally a Send... option was added to the export dialog allowing one to send the exported data to another application.  German translations will need to be added in a separate commit for the new strings.,

,Add a new game concept called a `flash'. This is a graphical effect taking non-zero time which is triggered by the making of a move and is _not_ hurried to its conclusion by the start of the next move (so the game redraw function is expected to be able to draw it in parallel with continuing moves). The only thing that prematurely terminates a flash is the start of a fresh flash. In particular this concept is used to display the completion flash in Net because at least _my_ playing instincts make me lock every piece I've unambiguously placed and hence the last turn move is instantly followed by a lock move which was previously suppressing the completion flash.  [originally from svn r4168],
,Add a new build type and set the proper PN_API_KEY on all build types.,
,Add a method to strip the Geek Markup from text. Use it in the geek list header,

If the user has previously already selected a language it will jump straight to the search page for that language otherwise it will default to the select language activity.,
,Add a label for progression show it to user and fix sms restauration.  This is almost finished but needs some polish,
,Add a generic function to modify the button assignments  This should support a per-player option in the future.,
,Add a facility in the latin.c solver diagnostics to allow a puzzle to call the digit values by custom names.  [originally from svn r8811],
,add a dialog for picking the copy destination,
,Add a delete node button,
,Add a couple of try/catch blocks to progress bars,

,add a button to reset preferences instead of the context menu item,
,add a button to clear inputs in triangle activity,
,Add a bunch of empty adhoc functions,
,Add a broadcast for state changes.  This allows the UI to receive updates when tracking starts and stops. Also added the location to location updates as it will be used when I split off the DB stuff later.,
,add a blank activity for the levÃ© orthogonal calculation,
,Add a better save location picker  Taken from another project might as well use it here. This layout did allow switching between storage devices but I found out how the storage framework works now and it's too much work to get it to work right now so the selection of storage is hidden. Reading works fine but writing requires a lot more code. Might pick it up later if there's a good library that does it for us. All the current code uses the normal File api so that has to be rewritten afaik.  Closes #202,
,Add a BaseFragment use an inline star to show default status,
,Add a `jumble' key (`J') to Net which scrambles the positions of all unlocked tiles randomly. (Rachel asked for this; it's been being tested for a good few months now and Simon didn't care either way so in it goes :)  As part of this the front end can now be asked to provide a random random seed (IYSWIM).
